<p class=header><a name=INTRO><b>INTRODUCTION</b> </a><a href="#top">[back to
top]</a> </p>

<p>Chuzzle Deluxe is the latest puzzle sensation
from the makers of Bejeweled® and Zuma®! The Chuzzles are googly-eyed little
balls of fur that giggle, squeak, and sneeze as you poke and push them across
the grid. Free them by forming groups of three or more, but watch out for the
tricky Puzzle Locks! Explore four different game modes as you earn trophies, unlock secret features, and more! Once you start
popping Chuzzles you might not be able to stop!</p>
<p><a name="I/CYP"><b>Create Your Profile</b></a></p>
<p>When you first launch Chuzzle Deluxe, you will
be asked for your name. Your progress and high scores will automatically be
saved when you quit. If there are several people playing on one computer, you
will want to create separate profiles for each person. To do this, click on
the link at the top of the screen that reads, &quot;Click here to change
profile.&quot; A dialog will appear allowing you to select another identity
or create a new one.</p>
<p><a name="I/GC"><b>Game Controls</b></a></p>
<p>Use your mouse cursor to click and drag the Chuzzles
in rows, either vertically or horizontally. Align Chuzzles
to form groups of three (or more) of the same color.</p>

<p class=header><a name=OBJ><b>OBJECTIVE</b> </a><a href="#top">[back to top]</a>
</p>

<p>Your objective in each level of Chuzzle Deluxe
is to form groups of three or more Chuzzles and
accumulate the greatest number of points per level, while deftly avoiding a
dreaded “no more moves” scenario. It won’t be easy! Pesky Puzzle Locks
randomly appear and lock Chuzzles in place! Large,
oafish, yet well-meaning Fat Chuzzles will crash
the party and take up two rows at once! But fear not, the Chuzzles
are here to help you! They will highlight with a starry outline the matches
you have discovered, and if you watch carefully, they just might give you a
hint!</p>
<p>Chuzzle characters and features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chuzzles
– The Chuzzles anxiously wait
their <b>whole</b> lives for the immeasurable joy of being joined
together with other Chuzzles. Join three or
more same-color Chuzzles together and watch
them explode with happiness!
<li>Fat
Chuzzles – These biggies can be matched with
regular Chuzzles, but when you click and drag
them, their sizeable bodies affect two Chuzzle
rows at the same time!
<li>Rainbow
Chuzzles – The rare and elusive rainbow Chuzzles can be more difficult to group, but worth
extra points if you can!
<li>Super
Chuzzles – Match five or more same-color Chuzzles at the same time to create a pulsing,
high-octane Super Chuzzle. Match the Super Chuzzle with same-color regular Chuzzles
and the results are highly explosive. Detonate a Super Chuzzle next to another Super Chuzzle
for a mega-blast!
<li>Puzzle
Locks – At random (but more frequently during higher levels) Puzzle
Locks will drop on Chuzzles, firmly locking
into place the Chuzzles and their
corresponding rows. Matching two or more same-color Chuzzles
with “locked” Chuzzles will break them out and
free the locked rows.
<li>Scrambles
– Scrambles allow you to refresh and shuffle the Chuzzle
grid if you have reached a point where no more matches can be made. You
only have a few, so try to save them!
</ul>

<p class=header><a name=GM><b>GAME MODES</b> </a><a href="#top">[back to top]</a>
</p>

<p><a name="GM/CC"><b>Classic </b></a><b>Chuzzle</b></p>
<p>The original puzzler! Classic Chuzzle is
available in two difficulty settings: Casual and Expert. (When you play Chuzzle for the first time, the game will default to
Classic Chuzzle in the “casual” difficulty mode.)</p>
<p>In both the Casual and Expert modes, all Chuzzle
characters and features are represented. You are given two Scrambles at the
beginning of the game, with the possibility to win more. (See “Scoring”
section.) The frequency of the Puzzle Locks will ease-in during Casual mode,
while they will be fast and furious in Expert.</p>
<p>(Also, you may find the Chuzzles to be
&quot;less helpful&quot; in the expert mode.)</p>
<p><a name="GM/SC"><b>Speed </b></a><b>Chuzzle</b></p>
<p>Not for the faint of heart, Speed Chuzzle adds
an intense twist that will drive you mad! Speed Chuzzle
keeps all the features of Classic Chuzzle, but adds
a timer. You will add time to the clock by making Chuzzle
matches, but once the timer runs out, one or more Puzzle Locks will drop! The
timer then resets and the countdown begins again! Frenetic fun for all.</p>
<p><a name="GM/ZC"><b>Zen </b></a><b>Chuzzle</b></p>
<p>Looking for a cute and fuzzy balm to soothe your nerves? Try Zen Chuzzle, where all Puzzle Locks and timers are
eliminated, leaving you nothing but a serene and blissful Chuzzling
experience.</p>
<p>In Zen Chuzzle, the rewards are many as you walk
the path to Chuzzlightenment.</p>
<p><a name="GM/MB"><b>Mind Bender</b></a></p>
<p>A completely different way to Chuzzle! In Mind
Bender, you must arrange the Chuzzles so that they
match a special pattern. Every level offers three new patterns and more
complex arrangements. Can your mind bend around all twenty levels?</p>

<p class=header><a name=OPT><b>OPTIONS</b> </a><a href="#top">[back to top]</a>
</p>

<p>The Options menu is accessible from the Main Menu screen, or by clicking
the Menu button while playing the game. Options include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Music
Volume and Sound Effects:</b> You can adjust these volume
sliders separately to fit your preferences.
<li><a name=WinMode></a><b>Windowed
Mode:</b> If this is not checked, Chuzzle Deluxe will fill your entire computer
screen. If it is checked, Chuzzle Deluxe will
be played within a window. You may choose how large the window is by
selecting a resolution size under &quot;Display&quot;.
<li><b>Custom
Cursors:</b> If this box is checked, you
will see special custom Chuzzle Deluxe cursors
in the game, rather than Windows standard cursors. If you have a special
theme installed that changes your Windows cursors, you may need to
de-activate this option to properly see the custom game cursors in the
game.
<li><b>HW
(Hardware) Acceleration:</b> This box can be checked to
spruce-up the game’s visuals and to improve performance for computers
with supported video cards.
<li><b>Colorblind
Mode:</b> This option will add symbols
to the tops of the Chuzzles, so that you do
not have to rely on colors to find matching Chuzzles.
<li><b>Display:</b>
See &quot;<a href="#WinMode">Windowed Mode</a>.&quot;
<li><b>Credits:</b>
Click this button to see who put the &quot;chuzz&quot;
in Chuzzle Deluxe.
<li><b>Update:</b>
Click this button to check for updates to Chuzzle
Deluxe.
<li><b>Help:</b>
This will give you a hand in starting a game of Chuzzle
Deluxe.
</ul>
<p><a name="OPT/HS"><b>High Scores</b></a></p>
<p>Your Classic Chuzzle and Speed Chuzzle scores will be automatically saved and displayed
on the High Scores screen, which is accessible by clicking the “High Scores”
button on the Main Menu. Flaunt and let your rivals weep.</p>
<p><b>Trophy Room</b></p>
<p>Trophies can be earned for special moves in all Chuzzle
game modes. Click the &quot;Trophy Room&quot; button to review the awards
that you’ve collected during gameplay. Roll your
cursor over the &quot;empty&quot; trophy slots to get a description of the
awards yet to be conquered.</p>
<p><a name="OPT/Q"><b>Quit</b></a></p>
<p>Clicking the Quit button on the main menu screen will exit and close the
game. But why would you ever want to do that?</p>

<p><br><b>Additional Notes:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>All
Chuzzle colors are equal in point value.
(Except for Rainbow Chuzzles.)
<li>There
are no additional points for exploding a Super Chuzzle.
<li>You
may acquire additional Scrambles at 150,000, 300,000 and 600,000 pts.
<li>Earn
double points for everything while playing the Expert level on Classic Chuzzle or Speed Chuzzle
modes.
<li>The
penalty for using the &quot;Hint&quot; button is the point total that
you’ve accrued within the last 10 matches.
<li>Chuzzles
have a secret fetish for stylish eyewear. No extra points are granted if
a random Chuzzle chooses to flaunt its
fabulous sense of style.
</ul>

<p class=header><a name=TIPS><b>GAMEPLAY TIPS</b> </a><a href="#top">[back to top]</a> </p>

<ul>
<li><b>Puzzle
Locks:</b> Don’t delay too long in
getting rid of a Puzzle Lock. The locks minimize the number of moves you
can make. Acquiring multiple locks could quickly bring your game to a
halt!
<li><b>Lock
Amnesty:</b> Make special moves like Combos
to temporarily prevent Puzzle Locks from dropping. You will also receive
temporary lock amnesty after clearing a Puzzle Lock.
<li><b>Fat
Chuzzles:</b>
Although they are cute, fluffy, and can earn you bonus points, Fat Chuzzles are proverbial “bulls in the china shop.”
Their mischief is threefold: 
<ol>
<li>Because
their presence affects four rows at once (2 vertically, 2 horizontally)
Fat Chuzzles may create an unwanted challenge
when Puzzle Locks are about. 
<li>Fat
Chuzzles cannot be dragged off the grid. 
<li>If
a match is made beneath a Fat Chuzzle and he
drops into the open space below him, his weight will push bottom row Chuzzles completely OFF the grid. (This is handy
for getting rid of a locked Chuzzle, but less
handy if you lose a potential match.) Unless you’re aiming for the “Big
Boy” trophy, it’s best not to delay in moving the big guys off the
grid. 
</ol>
<li><b>Speed
Chuzzle Warning:</b>
While playing Speed Chuzzle, you’ll hear the
timer make a “clinking” sound. This is an alert to inform you that the
timer is just about up. Clear two levels without getting the warning
sound and win a “Speed Master” trophy!
<li><b>Zen
Chuzzle Charms:</b>
In Zen Chuzzle mode, your ongoing efforts will
be rewarded in lovely Chuzzle Charms. There
are no additional rewards or “symbolic meaning” in the charms, outside
of their own beauty and collectability.
</ul>
<p><b>Additional notes:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Puzzle
Locks appear randomly, though more frequently during higher levels.
Temporary amnesty can be gained through special moves like Combos.
<li>Fat
Chuzzles randomly appear after you match or
cascade a 2X2 square block of Chuzzles.
<li>Rainbow
Chuzzles randomly appear, regardless of player
input.
<li>The
Chuzzle is a naturally musical creature and
enjoys collaborating in &quot;Right-Click Concertos.&quot;
<li>Receive
a &quot;Flawless&quot; trophy for playing an entire game without making
a bad move. A &quot;bad&quot; move is defined as “moving a line of Chuzzles without making a match”.
<li>Chuzzles
are very excitable and ticklish and should be handled with care.
Excessive poking may cause unexpected results.
