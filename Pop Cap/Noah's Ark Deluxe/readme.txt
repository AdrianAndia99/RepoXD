with a Pentium II 300 Mhz or better processor. Your computer must have
at least 64 megabytes of RAM.

Operating System: you must be utilizing Windows 95, 98, 2000, ME, or XP

1.2 RECOMMENDED SPECS

PopCap® recommends an IBM PC or 100% compatible computer, with a
Pentium II 500 Mhz or better processor.


===================================
2.0 TROUBLESHOOTING / COMPATIBILITY
===================================

For updates to this list go to www.popcap.com.

2.1  DirectX®

Noah's Ark requires you to have DirectX 5 drivers installed.
These are sound and video drivers from Microsoft used in
many games. If you need the latest version of DirectX, go to
http://www.microsoft.com/directx.

2.2  Screen Color Depth

Noah's Ark requires you to be running in 16bit color or better. It
may not function in Windowed mode properly in 256 colors. If you
are running in 256 colors, the game will try to switch to full
screen mode.

In addition, the game may run slowly in windowed mode in 32 bit
color. If this occurs, switch to full-screen mode, or change
your color depth to 16 bits.

2.3  Bug Reporting

Though we've tried our best to squash all the bugs, every once in
a while something we didn't expect pops up...

If you should come across a bug in Noah's Ark, please report it to
bugs@popcap.com.

If for some reason the program crashes, it will try to capture any
pertinent data and give you instructions on how to send that data
to PopCap. This is very helpful for tracking down glitches! This 
information is also stored in a file called CRASH.TXT in your
Dynomite directory (C:/PROGRAM FILES/POPCAP GAMES/NOAHSARK by
default). If you can, include this text file with any email you
send to PopCap about crashes.


===================
3.0 GETTING STARTED
===================

3.1 GOAL

The goal of Noah's Ark is to save animals, two by two, by linking them
to each other on the game field. Once connected, pairs of animals will
fly into the Ark!

3.2 GAME TYPES

After the game loads, you will see a screen allowing you to choose
Action mode, Strategy mode, or Puzzle mode. If you have a saved game,
you will also see the option to continue that saved game. There is 
also the option to quit back to Windows.

* ACTION MODE

Also known as the "Flood" mode in the web version. In Action mode, you
must save animals quickly, before the rising flood waters reach the Ark!

When you quit out of Strategy mode, your game will automatically be
saved. You can continue it the next time you play by choosing Classic
mode again.

* STRATEGY MODE

Also known as "Freefall" mode in the web game. Strategy mode is a slower,
turn-based game, where you can take as long as you like to pick animals,
but the pieces are affected by gravity.

As in Action, your game is automatically saved whenever you quit, and
can be continued by selecting Continue Saved Game the next time you play.

* PUZZLE MODE

Fans of a certain gem-based game from PopCap will find this bonus mode
strangely familiar.

This mode is locked so that you can only play for a few minutes. To
unlock Puzzle mode, you must register your game!

3.3 DIFFICULTY SETTINGS

After you select a game type, you must select a difficulty, Easy, Medium,
or Hard. The tougher game settings award more points!

================
4.0 INSTRUCTIONS
================

4.1 CONTROLS

Noah's Ark is controlled entirely with the mouse. Select an animal by
clicking on it. You can deselect it by clicking on it a second time. Link
it to another animal by clicking on the second animal.

You can also drag a connection from one animal to the next. Click and hold
on the first animal, then move the cursor to the second animal and release.

4.2 GAMEPLAY

Animals must be removed in pairs of the same type. There needs to be a
clear path from one to the other for them to be removed. For instance,
an animal that is surrounded by animals of a different sort cannot be
connected to one further away. 
  
4.3 COMBOS

You score a combo when you remove 2 or more sets of the same animal type
in a row. For instance, if you clear 2 lions, then another set of 2 lions,
you have just made a simple combo. Getting larger ones, like 9 sets of
elephants in a row, is much harder, but also much more valuable.

Combos do two things... they give you extra points, and they will reduce
your flood level. This can be very important later in the game, giving
you more time before the waters rise dangerously high!

4.4 ACTION MODE

Action mode is a realtime game... if you snooze, you lose! Watch the
flood waters rising... when they reach the ark, it will sail away
without you, and the game is over!

Your goal is to clear the board before this happens, so you can proceed
to the next level. 

4.5 STRATEGY MODE

This is a turn-based game. You can take as long as you like making your
moves. However, it's a little tricker than Action mode, because the
animals are affected by gravity, and will fall down when the tiles
under them are removed.

When there are no more possible moves, some animals will be abandoned!
This causes the flood levels to rise. When the flood level reaches the
ark, your game is over!

4.6 PUZZLE MODE

As in a certain gem-based game of ours, the goal in Puzzle mode is to swap
adjacent animals to create sets of 3 or more in a row. Do this as many 
times as you can before the flood gets too high!

4.7 BONUS LEVEL

After every 3 levels, you'll get a chance at the bonus Stampede Round!
Don't worry, you can't lose the game here...just try to make as many points
as you can!

===========
5.0 OPTIONS
===========

You can access various options for Noah's Ark Deluxe by clicking the 
Options button on the sidebar.

5.1 MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS

You can raise or lower the volume for either of these independently
by moving the respective slider. To turn music or sound off, move
the slider all the way to the left.

5.2 FULLSCREEN MODE

You can play Noah's Ark in either windowed or full-screen mode. To 
toggle between the two, click on the checkbox next to Fullscreen.

You may see faster performance in full-screen mode, depending on
your system.

5.3 DISABLE HINTS

This will disable the hints that automatically appear when you have
taken too long to make a move, showing you a possible match.
Experienced players may feel this makes the game too easy, so they
have the option of disabling them.

==================
6.0 REGISTRATION
==================

If you enjoy playing the Trial version of Noah's Ark, sooner or later
you'll need to register!

6.1 BENEFITS OF REGISTERING

When you register, it removes all the annoying nags from the loading
screen, and unlocks your copy of Noah's Ark so you can play it as often
as you like! High scores are also enabled, and the bonus Puzzle mode is
unlocked!

6.2 HOW TO REGISTER

To unlock the game, you need to buy a registration code online, and then
enter it into Noah's Ark.

6.3  BUY A REGISTRATION CODE ONLINE

If you're playing Noah's Ark, click on the OPTIONS button on the sidebar and
then click REGISTER. A dialog will come up onscreen. Click the REGISTER ONLINE
link to launch your web browser. You'll need to have an active internet connection!

You can also register via the web. Go to:
 http://www.popcap.com/register.php?theGame=noahsark
and click the Registration link.

Once you're there, follow the directions on the web site to purchase your
registration code. You can use your credit card online to buy it, or fax your
purchase in, or send a money order.

When complete, you will be given a registration code (a 20-character sequence
of letters and numbers) keyed to your name. Don't give this to anyone else! 

You will also receive a copy sent to your email address. You should write down 
your registration code in case you ever have a computer crash or need to reinstall
Noah's Ark for some other reason.

6.4  ENTER YOUR REGISTRATION CODE

You must launch Noah's Ark to enter your registration code. Once the game comes up,
click on the REGISTER link on the loading screen, or from the OPTIONS menu.

A dialog will come up with space for you to enter your name and registration code.
Type these in carefully! If you make a mistake, your code may not be recognized. 

The easiest way to do this is to cut and paste the code from the email you were
sent, by highlighting the 20-digit number with your mouse, pressing ctrl-c to copy
the text, and then pressing ctrl-v to paste it into the registration dialog in
Noah's Ark.

Be sure to use the same name you gave when you bought your registration code
online, or your registration may not be recognized. 

Once you've entered your name and registration code, click OK and your copy of 
Noah's Ark should now be registered. You will have full access to all the game's
features, with no delay at the loading screen!

6.5 PROBLEMS?

If the program doesn't seem to recognize your registration code, check carefully
that you've typed it in correctly. Using the cut-and-paste method described above
can help prevent mistakes. Also make sure you're using the same name you used to
register with.

If you can't get to the online registration site to buy your registration code, 
make sure your internet connection is working properly. You must be connected to
the internet. If it still doesn't work, check back in a little while to see if
there was a temporary problem with our servers.

Lost your registration code? Email us at feedback@popcap.com or go to
www.popcap.com/support.php and we'll try to recover it for you. Make sure to let
us know the name of the game you bought, the name you purchased it under, and 
the approximate date of purchase... this'll make it a lot easier for us to search
our records. 

However, no PopCap employee will EVER ask you for your registration code or your
credit card number. 

Don't have a credit card, or don't want to enter it online? You can choose to fax
your credit card number in, or send a money order instead, by selecting the 
appropriate option on the Payment Method selector on the web page.

Hopefully this will answer all your questions, but if you're still having
difficulties, feel free to contact us at feedback@popcap.com. Include as much
information as you can about the problem you're having, and we'll get back to
