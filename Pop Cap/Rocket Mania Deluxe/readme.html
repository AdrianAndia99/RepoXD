<A name="I"><B>INSTRUCTIONS</B> <A href="#top">[back to top]</A></A>
</P>

<P><A name="I/G"><B>Goal</B></A></P>
<P>The goal of Rocket Mania is to create a fuse to link a burning match to one or more rockets.</P>
<P>There are three game modes: Classic, Arcade and Strategy. But the basics remain the same for both... rotate the tiles and try to create a fuse that launches as many rockets as possible at one time. Pick up bonus items along the way by including them in the path of a fuse. In Classic and Arcade modes, you can upgrade your rockets by picking up coins.</P>
<P><A name="I/GB"><B>Gameplay Basics</B></A></P>
<P>In all three game modes, there are matches on the left hand side, and rockets on the right hand side. In between, there are fuse blocks. These fuses rotate counter-clockwise when clicked, and will rotate clockwise when right-clicked. To launch a rocket, you must form an unbroken path of fuses from the match to the rocket(s). When a fuse is complete, all rockets linked to a match will automatically launch. You have a fraction of a second to quickly turn a connected fuse block if you change your mind and want to change the path of the fuse you have created. If you are really quick, you can even add extra fuses blocks to your chain while the fuse starts to burn.</P>
<P>HINT: Try to connect fuses to the rockets FIRST, then work backwards and connect your rockets to a match. Remember, one match can launch multiple rockets!</P>
<P><A name="I/IT"><B>Interface Tips</B></A></P>
<P><B>Pause:</B> You can pause the game either by clicking the PAUSE button, or by pressing the spacebar on your keyboard.</P>
<P><B>Full Screen Mode:</B> You can enter or exit full screen mode either by using the checkbox in the OPTIONS dialog, or by pressing the ALT and ENTER keys on your keyboard at the same time.</P>
<P><B>Rotating Tiles:</B> You can rotate tiles by using the left or right mouse buttons - the left mouse button rotates the fuse counter-clockwise, the right mouse button rotates the fuse clockwise.</P>
<P><B>Dragging Tiles:</B> This can only be done in Arcade mode. You can drag a tile to a new location by pressing down the mouse button, dragging the mouse, and releasing the mouse button.</P>
<P><A name="I/GM"><B>Game Modes</B></A></P>
<P>After the game loads, you will see a screen allowing you to choose Classic, Arcade or Strategy modes. New players should start with Classic or Strategy modes, while experienced Rocket Mania players may prefer the more frantic and action-packed Arcade mode.</P>
<P><A name="I/CG"><B>Classic Game</B></A></P>
<P>This is the original game of Rocket Mania. This is a timed game.</P>
<P>You will see a Rocket Counter in the left-hand side bar. This shows how many rockets you must launch to progress to the next level. At the top of the screen is a string of lanterns; this is your timer and when dawn approaches these lanterns will all fizzle out. You will lose if you do not launch all your rockets before the last lantern burns out.</P>
<P><A name="I/AG"><B>Arcade Game</B></A></P>
<P>The Arcade mode is a far more fast-paced game. This is an untimed game and you can move the fuse blocks by clicking and dragging them.</P>
<P>This is similar to Classic mode in that you must launch a certain number of rockets to advance to the next level. But in Arcade mode, you only start with a few fuses at the bottom of the screen. New fuse blocks fall down at regular intervals but you must make sure they do not fill the screen or you will lose. Arcade mode is unique since you can MOVE fuse blocks by clicking and dragging them. You can only move a fuse to a new location that is at the same level or lower, and as long as there are no other fuses in the way.</P>
<P>If you want the game to play faster or you need more fuse blocks, click on the area where the tiles are dropping from and a new line of fuses will drop.</P>
<P>If any column of fuses touches the top of the screen, you only have a few seconds of grace time to move fuse blocks out of the offending column(s), or clear some fuses by launching rockets.</P>
<P><A name="I/SG"><B>Strategy Game</B></A></P>
<P>The Strategy mode is a much more thoughtful game, great for practice and for setting up mega rocket launches. This is an untimed game.</P>
<P>In Strategy mode, you have a limited number of matches you can use. The number of matches you have remaining is shown in the Match Counter in the left-hand sidebar. When you have used all your matches the game is over. The goal is to get the highest score with your available matches. So, use your matches wisely to maximize your points - there is no time pressure so you can try to set up giant rocket launches.</P>
<P>You can earn extra matches by launching 3 or more fireworks at one time. The more rockets you launch, the more matches will fall down. When new matches drop down, you must pick them up within three turns or they will fizzle out and disappear. To pick up a match, include it in the path of any fuse that launches a rocket. You can only store up to 20 matches maximum at one time.</P>
<P><A name="I/BI"><B>Bonus Items</B></A></P>
<P>There are a number of bonus items you can get by including them in the path of any fuse that launches a rocket.</P>
<P><B>Coins:</B> Coins are a very important part of the game. Coins are used to upgrade your rockets, and upgraded rockets are worth more points. When you launch multiple rockets at once, the cheering crowd will throw out coins in appreciation - the bigger the launch, the more coins that are given. These coins fall and you must pick them up. These coins go into your coin box and are used to upgrade your rockets at the beginning of the next level. When you have upgraded ALL your rockets, coins go towards your score.</P>
<P>Coins are available in Classic and Arcade modes only.</P>
<P><B>Gems:</B> Gems are thrown out occasionally by an appreciative audience. Collect them to add to your score.</P>
<P>Gems are available in Classic and Arcade modes only.</P>
<P><B>Bombs:</B> Bombs can be used to clear away fuse blocks and add some oomph to your show. Be careful though, since bombs will also clear any coins or gems that are close by. Bombs are especially handy in Arcade mode when you are in a jam.</P>
<P>Bombs are available in Classic and Arcade modes only.</P>
<P><B>Clocks:</B> Clocks will freeze the timer for a few seconds so you have more time to complete a level. If you grab 2 clocks at one time, the timer will freeze for twice as long.</P>
<P>Clocks are available in Classic mode only.</P>
<P><B>Matches:</B> These drop down when you launch three or more rockets at one time in Strategy mode. Each time you launch a rocket without picking up a fallen match, it will glow less brightly. If you do not pick it up within 3 turns, the match will fizzle out and disappear.</P>
<P>Matches are only available in Strategy mode.</P>
<P><A name="I/O"><B>Options</B></A></P>
<P>The Options are accessible by clicking the Options button while playing the game. They include:
<UL>
	<LI><B>Music Volume and Sound Effects:</B> you can adjust these volume sliders separately to fit your preferences.</LI>
	<LI><B>Fullscreen:</B> If this is checked, Rocket Mania Deluxe will use your entire computer screen. If it is not checked, Rocket Mania Deluxe will be played in a window. It’s up to you to decide which you prefer.</LI>
	<LI><B>Custom Cursors:</B> If this box is checked, you will see special custom Rocket Mania Deluxe cursors in the game rather than Windows standard cursors. If you have a special theme installed that changes your Windows cursors, you may need to activate this option to see the cursor properly in the game.</LI>
	<LI><B>Hardware Acceleration:</B> This box can be checked to improve performance for computers with supported video cards.</LI>
	<LI><B>Disable Hints and Tooltips:</B> When this option is checked, all hint boxes and in-game tooltips will no longer be displayed. You can re-enable this by unchecking this box. In some cases, you can disable a hint when it pops up; these hints are not affected by this checkbox and will remain disabled. Use RESET HINTS to restore all hints back to their original settings.</LI>
	<LI><B>Reset Hints:</B> Clicking this button will reset all game hints back to their original settings. This is helpful when someone new to the game wants to try it out but you have disabled some or all of the hints.</LI>

<A name="SC"><B>SCORING</B> <A href="#top">[back to top]</A></A>
</P>

<P>Your score is based on many factors. The following values are for the Easy Difficulty level - multiply them by 1.5 for Medium and 2 for Hard difficulty.</P>

<P><B>Fuses:</B> 5 points are earned for each fuse block burnt.</P>
<P><B>Rockets:</B> Rockets are worth 100 points multiplied by the number on the rocket.</P>
<P><B>Gems:</B> They are worth from 500 up to 1000 points, depending on the type of gem.</P>
<P><B>Coins:</B> When you have upgraded all your rockets, each 1 value coin is worth 500 
points and these are added to your score. Also, the score for a rocket 
launch is multiplied by the number of coins you pick up - so if you pick 
up 4 coins (regardless of the actual coin value), then your launch score 
will be multiplied by 4!</P>
<P><B>Matches:</B> When you have the maximum number of matches, extra matches earned are worth 
300 points.</P>
<P><B>Combos:</B> Combos are instances where fuses fall down after a rocket launch and 
automatically create a new launch. These are worth 2000 points.</P>
<P><B>Multiple Rocket Launches:</B> Extra bonuses are awarded for multiple rockets launched at one time.
<BR>1000 for a 5x launch
<BR>2500 for a 6x 
<BR>10000 for a 7x 
<BR>25000 for an 8x
<BR>100000 for a 9x</P>
