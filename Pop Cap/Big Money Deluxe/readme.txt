===================================
2.0 TROUBLESHOOTING / COMPATIBILITY
===================================

For updates to this list go to http://www.popcap.com.

2.1 DirectX®

Big Money Deluxe requires you to have DirectX® 6 or better drivers 
installed. These are sound and video drivers from Microsoft used in
many games. If you need the latest version of DirectX®, go to
http://www.microsoft.com/directx. 

2.2 Screen Color Depth

Big Money Deluxe requires you to be running in 16bit color or better. 
It may not function in Windowed mode properly in 256 colors. If you
are running in 256 colors, the game will try to switch to full
screen mode.

In addition, the game may run slowly in windowed mode in 32 bit
color. If this occurs, switch to full-screen mode, or change
your color depth to 16 bits.

2.3 Bug Reporting

Though we've tried our best to squash all the bugs, every once in
a while something we didn't expect pops up...

If you should come across a bug in Big Money Deluxe, please report it 
to bugs@popcap.com.

If for some reason the program crashes, it will try to capture any
pertinent data and give you instructions on how to send that data
to PopCap. This is very helpful for tracking down glitches! This 
information is also stored in a file called CRASH.TXT in your
Big Money directory (C:/PROGRAM FILES/POPCAP GAMES/BIG MONEY DELUXE by
default). If you can, include this text file with any email you
send to PopCap about crashes.


===================
3.0 GETTING STARTED
===================

3.1 GOAL

The goal of Big Money is to become rich by collecting as many coins 
and money bags as you can!

There are three game types, Action, Strategy, and Puzzle, and the 
specifics of how to play depend on which game you choose.

3.2 GAME TYPES

After the game loads, you will see a screen allowing you to choose 
Action, Strategy, or Puzzle Mode. You can also set your Skill Level 
to Easy, Normal, or Hard on this screen. Choose a game mode and 
difficulty level to get started!

3.3 ACTION

This is the "classic" mode of Big Money. In Action mode, everything 
happens in real time, so you'll need to be quick on your toes (and 
your mouse finger!) to keep up!

To pass each level, you need to collect a certain number of money 
bags. The number of bags needed is shown on the left hand side of the 
screen. As you collect them, the dark bag-shaped slots will be filled 
in. When you've collected the necessary number, you'll proceed to the 
next level!

As you play, you'll see new coins being minted at the bottom of the 
screen continually. If the coins ever reach the top of the screen, 
you'll get a warning and a 3-second countdown, and then your game 
will end!

To remove coins from the screen, you just have to click on groups of 3 
or more adjacent coins of the same color. They'll disappear from the 
screen, earning you points... the more you eliminate at once, the 
better your score will do.

Grabbing coins will also cause the Money Meter on the right to rise. 
Be careful, the level will fall if you don't keep grabbing coins! 
When the Money Meter hits the top, a Money Bag will drop from above!

To collect a moneybag, you have to remove the coin it's sitting on. 
Sometimes this will be easy, if there are already 3 or more coins of 
the same color under the bag. Other times it will be more difficult, 
and you'll need to work at other areas of the board before you can 
access the money bag.

Occasionally, you may see a spinning Dollar Bomb appear. If you remove 
the bag under a Dollar Bomb, it'll detonate, blowing up all coins of 
that color onscreen. Use this bonus wisely!

You can pause an Action game at any time by pressing the SPACE BAR, 
and start it up again by clicking on the screen.


3.4 STRATEGY

Strategy mode is very similar to Action, except that you can proceed 
at your own pace. Coins do not automatically appear... they rise up 
only after you make a move, by eliminating a group of coins onscreen.

You can go as fast or as slow as you want, but eventually you'll have 
to be careful what coins you grab. As the coin level rises more with 
each move, you'll need to optimize your moves to collect the most 
coins with each possible move.

Other than the pace, Strategy mode plays identically to Action mode.


3.5 PUZZLE

Puzzle mode is quite different from Action and Puzzle modes. In 
Puzzle, no new coins appear once a level begins. Instead, your task is 
to remove as many coins as possible from the screen, causing the 
moneybags to drop off the bottom.

There are 2 major rule differences in Puzzle mode:

* You can click on groups of 2 or more coins, instead of 3 or more, to
  collect them.

* To grab a moneybag, you need to drop it to the very bottom of the 
  screen, instead of just removing the coin directly beneath it.

As in the other modes, you need to collect a certain number of 
moneybags to advance to the next level. You have to be careful here, 
though, and make sure you remove coins in such a way that you form new 
blocks of coins you can remove. Remember that columns of coins will 
move together if there's a blank space between them.

When there are no more possible moves, because there are no groups of 
2 or more adjoining coins, the game will end. 

Every puzzle can be solved, but don't expect it to be easy!


===========
4.0 OPTIONS
===========

You can change game settings by clicking the OPTIONS button on the 
sidebar.

4.1 MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS

The two sliders at the top of the Options dialog control the volume 
of the sound effects and music. You can adjust them separately. If you 
want to turn the music or sound off completely, just drag the slider 
all the way to the left.

4.2 FULLSCREEN

The Fullscreen option is enabled by checking the box next to it. This 
will cause Big Money to take up the whole screen. Some players may 
prefer this, while others may like it better in a window, where they 
can easily switch to other applications. To change back to windowed 
mode, just uncheck the Fullscreen box.

4.3 CUSTOM CURSORS

This option will enable custom cursors within Big Money, instead of 
using your default Windows cursors. If you have an unusual Windows 
theme, or are otherwise seeing strange mouse cursor behavior, you may 
want to enable this option.

4.4 HELP

Clicking this button will bring up a brief screen with instructions on 
your selected game mode.

4.5 SCORES

Clicking this button will show you the top 5 scores in each of the 
three modes: Action, Strategy, and Puzzle.

4.6 CREDITS

Click this to see the fine folks who brought you Big Money!

4.7 CHECK FOR UPDATES

Click this button to check our website for updates to your version of 
Big Money. This requires an active Internet connection.

4.8 REGISTER

Click this button to register your game via the internet. See the 
section the on registration, 6.0.

===========
5.0 SCORING
===========

Scoring in Action and Strategy modes is identical.

5.1 ACTION AND STRATEGY

You score points for clearing coins, depending on the number of coins
in the set.

A set of 3 coins is worth 10 points. A set of 4 is worth 15 points.
 
5 coins:   20 pts
6 coins:   30 pts
7 coins:   40 pts
8 coins:   50 pts
9 coins:   65 pts
10 coins:  80 pts
11 coins:  95 pts
12 coins:  115 pts
13 coins:  135 pts
14 coins:  155 pts
15+ coins: 180 pts

per Moneybag grabbed: 100 pts

On Easy mode, these values are halved. On Hard, they're multiplied by 
1.5.

In addition, each level you make it past increases the value by 10%.

Finally, you can score extra points with the various combos and 
bonuses. Experiment to see what works!


5.2 PUZZLE

In Puzzle mode, you can make sets of 2 coins, which are worth a base 
value of 5 points.

All points scored are multiplied by 3 in Puzzle mode.

In addition you receive a bonus at the end of each level based on the
number of coins left on the screen.

6.0 REGISTRATION
================

If you enjoy playing the Trial version of Big Money Deluxe, sooner or later
you'll need to register!

You can also register via the web. Go to http://www.popcap.com/bigmoney and
click the Registration link.

Once you're there, follow the directions on the web site to purchase your
registration code. You can use your credit card online to buy it, or fax your
purchase in, or send a money order.

When complete, you will be given a registration code (a 20-character sequence
of letters and numbers) keyed to your name. Don't give this to anyone else! 

You will also receive a copy sent to your email address. You should write down
your registration code in case you ever have a computer crash or need to

6.5 PROBLEMS?

If the program doesn't seem to recognize your registration code, check carefully
that you've typed it in correctly. Using the cut-and-paste method described above
can help prevent mistakes. Also make sure you're using the same name you used to
register with.

If you can't get to the online registration site to buy your registration code, 
make sure your internet connection is working properly. You must be connected to
the internet. If it still doesn't work, check back in a little while to see if 
there was a temporary problem with our servers.

Lost your registration code? Email us at feedback@popcap.com and we'll try to
recover it for you. Make sure to let us know the name of the game you bought,
the name you purchased it under, and the approximate date of purchase... this'll
make it a lot easier for us to search our records.

your credit card number in, or send a money order instead, by selecting the
appropriate option on the Payment Method selector on the web page.

There is currently no way to buy a CDROM containing Big Money Deluxe, but this
