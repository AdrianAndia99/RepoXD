<p><b>Troubleshooting</b></p>
<p>This software has been tested to operate on the above system requirements. If you experience any problems such as system crashes, any graphics issues or error messages, please try one of the following:</p>
<p>1) Update your computer's video or sound card drivers. This can be done by identifying the type of sound card and video card your computer is using and finding the manufacturer's web site where new drivers may be made available for download.</p>
<p>2) Upgrade DirectX. This is a Microsoft component and can improve the graphics, security, and performance of your Windows operating system.</p>
<p>3) If 1 and 2 do not fix graphic problems please go to the &quot;Options&quot; menu available on the main menu and UNCHECK &quot;Use Hardware Acceleration&quot;. If you change the &quot;Use Hardware Acceleration&quot; you need to close the game and launch it again for the new setting to begin.</p>
<p>4) If you are having general issues with the game or your PC is running slow it is always a good idea to restart your PC.</p>
