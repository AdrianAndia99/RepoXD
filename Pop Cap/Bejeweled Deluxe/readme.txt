1.0 REQUIRED SPECS AND RECOMMENDED SPECS
========================================

least 32 megabytes of RAM.

Operating System: you must be utilizing Windows 95, 98, 2000, ME, or 
XP with DirectX to play BEJEWELED DELUXE on your system.

Controls: a keyboard and a 100% Microsoft compatible mouse are

Video: you must have your desktop set to 16-bit or 32-bit Color (256

===================================
2.0 TROUBLESHOOTING / COMPATIBILITY
===================================

For Updates To This List Go To www.popcap.com.

2.1  DirectX

If you need the latest version of DirectX, go to
http://www.microsoft.com/directx.

2.2  Screen Color Depth

Bejeweled Deluxe requires you to be running in 16-bit color or better. 
It may not function in Windowed mode properly in 256 colors. If you 
are running in 256 colors, the game will try to switch to full screen 
mode.

In addition, the game may run slowly in windowed mode in 32-bit color. 
If this occurs, switch to full-screen mode, or change your color depth 
to 16-bit.

2.3  Bug Reporting

Though we've tried our best to squash all the bugs, every once in a 
while something we didn't expect pops up...

If you should come across a bug in Bejeweled Deluxe, please report it 
to
bugs@popcap.com.

If for some reason the program crashes, it will try to capture any 
pertinent data and give you instructions on how to send that data to 
PopCap. This is very helpful for tracking down glitches! This 
information is also stored in a file called CRASH.TXT in your 
Bejeweled Deluxe directory 
(C:/PROGRAM FILES/POPCAP GAMES/BEJEWELED DELUXE by default). If you 
can, include this text file with any email you send to PopCap about 
crashes.

================
3.0 INSTRUCTIONS
================

3.1 GOAL

The object of the game is to score as many points as possible by 
swapping adjacent gems to create sets, either horizontal or vertical, 
of 3 or more identical gems.

3.2 CONTROLS

Swap any two adjacent gems by clicking on one, then the one you want 
to swap it with. The gems must be adjacent vertically or horizontally 
(not diagonally).

You must create a valid set of three or more identical gems with each 
move, or the gems will revert back to their original position.

Sets can be either horizontal or vertical, and can contain more than 
3 gems. When you have successfully created a set, they will disappear 
and new gems will fall into place, possibly creating a chain reaction 
or 'cascade' of more sets.

You can also swap gems by clicking on one, then dragging it in the 
direction you want to swap. This can be faster and more efficient 
once you're used to it!

3.3 HINTS

You can get a Hint at any time by clicking the purple Hint button on 
the left-hand control bar. This will cause a gem onscreen to flash 
briefly, indicating that it can be used to create a set.

However, every time you use the Hint button, you will lose points!

In Timetrial mode, you will also lose several seconds of time.

3.4 OPTIONS

You can adjust the volume for the sound effects and music separately.

You can also toggle between full-screen and windowed mode, depending 
on your preference. The game may run slower in windowed mode, 
especially if you are running your desktop at 32-bit color instead of 
16-bit.

From the Options screen you can also access some basic Help and the 
Registration system (see Registration later in this document).

3.5 GAME MODES

You can play BEJEWELED DELUXE in either Normal or Timetrial mode. 
Switch modes by clicking the appropriate button on the left-hand 
control bar. You will have to abandon your game in progress to switch 
game modes.

3.6 NORMAL MODE

In Normal mode, there is no timer and you can take as long as you like 
to make each move. The game will end when there are no more available 
moves.

Every set or cascade you create will cause the Bonus Bar at the 
bottom of the screen to increment upwards. When the Bonus Bar is full, 
you will proceed to the next level.

Each successive level increases the value of all sets and combos!

3.7 TIMETRIAL MODE

Timetrial mode is for experienced Bejeweled Deluxe players who want a 
fast-paced challenge. In Timetrial, the Bonus Bar at the bottom of the 
screen continually counts down towards zero. When it hits the bottom, 
your game is over.

You can replenish the Bonus Bar by creating sets and combos. The 
bigger the combo or cascade, the more the Bonus Bar will be 
regenerated.

Filling the Bonus Bar will take you to the next level. Sets and combos 
are worth more on each successive level, but the timer will also count 
down much faster!

You can press any key to PAUSE the game while playing Timetrial.

3.8 SCORING

You receive a base score of 10 points for each set you create. 

Sets of 4 or 5 gems are worth 20 or 30 points respectively.

Each set triggered after the first in a single move (a combo or 
cascade) is worth more points. The first combo is worth 2x the normal 
points, the second 3x, and so on.

Each successive level in Normal mode adds 0.5 to the point multiplier 
for all these events, so a basic set is worth 15 points on level 2.

Timetrial mode starts out at double the value of Normal mode, so sets 
are worth 20 points. Each successive level in Timetrial adds 0.5 to 
this multiplier; so on level 2 sets are worth 30 points.

==================
4.0 REGISTRATION
==================

If you enjoy playing the Trial version of Bejeweled Deluxe, sooner or later 
you'll need to register!

4.1 	BENEFITS OF REGISTERING

When you register, it removes all the annoying nag screens and loading 
delays from the program, and enables various other features:

 * High scores are enabled
 * Play as often as you like!
 * Faster load time - no delay screen!

4.2 	HOW TO REGISTER

To unlock the game, you need to buy a registration code online, and 
then enter it into Bejeweled Deluxe.

4.3 	BUY A REGISTRATION CODE ONLINE

If you're playing Bejeweled Deluxe, click on the OPTIONS button and then 
click REGISTER. A dialog will come up onscreen. Click the REGISTER 
ONLINE link to launch your web browser. You'll need to have an active 
internet connection!

You can also register via the web. Go to http://www.popcap.com/bejeweled.php
and click the Registration link.

Once you're there, follow the directions on the web site to purchase 
your registration code. You can use your credit card online to buy it, 
or fax your purchase in, or send a money order.

When complete, you will be given a registration code (a 20-character 
sequence of letters and numbers) keyed to your name. Don't give this to 
anyone else! 

You will also receive a copy sent to your email address. You should 
write down your registration code in case you ever have a computer 
crash or need to reinstall Bejeweled Deluxe for some other reason.

4.4 	ENTER YOUR REGISTRATION CODE

You must launch Bejeweled Deluxe to enter your registration code.
Once the game comes up, click on the REGISTER link on the loading
screen, or from the OPTIONS menu.

A dialog will come up with space for you to enter your name and 
registration code. Type these in carefully! If you make a mistake,
your code may not be recognized. 

The easiest way to do this is to cut and paste the code from the email 
you were sent, by highlighting the 20-digit number with your mouse, 
pressing ctrl-c to copy the text, and then pressing ctrl-v to paste it 
into the registration dialog in Bejeweled Deluxe.

Be sure to use the same name you gave when you bought your registration 
code online, or your registration may not be recognized. 

Once you've entered your name and registration code, click OK and your 
copy of Bejeweled Deluxe should now be registered. You will have full
access to all the game's features, with no limitations!

4.5 	PROBLEMS?

If the program doesn't seem to recognize your registration code, check 
carefully that you've typed it in correctly. Using the cut-and-paste 
method described above can help prevent mistakes. Also make sure you're 
using the same name you used to register with.

If you can't get to the online registration site to buy your 
registration code, make sure your internet connection is working 
properly. You must be connected to the internet. If it still doesn't 
work, check back in a little while to see if there was a temporary 
problem with our servers.

Lost your registration code? Email us at feedback@popcap.com and we'll 
try to recover it for you. Make sure to let us know the name of the 
game you bought, the name you purchased it under, and the approximate 
date of purchase... this'll make it a lot easier for us to search our 
records.

Don't have a credit card, or don't want to enter it online? You can 
choose to fax your credit card number in, or send a money order 
instead, by selecting the appropriate option on the Payment Method 
selector on the web page.

Hopefully this will answer all your questions, but if you're still 
having difficulties, feel free to contact us at feedback@popcap.com.
