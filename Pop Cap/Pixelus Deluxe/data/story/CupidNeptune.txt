Cupid:
I love what you're doing with my floors.
I will do what I can to help you.
Claudius:
I wish to gain an audience with Jupiter,
so that I can leave this island.
Can you arrange it?
Cupid:
Unfortunately grandfather is angry with me.
You could try talking to uncle Neptune.
Go to the watery temple to the east.
