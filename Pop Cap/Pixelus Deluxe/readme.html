<A name="HTP"><B>HOW TO PLAY</B> <A href="#top">[back to top]</A></A>
</P>

<P><A name="HTP/C"><B>Controls</B></A></P>
<P>Place your mouse cursor on the position where you want to place a tile. Click your left mouse button to place the tile.</P>
<P>To remove a tile you have already placed, position the cursor on top of the tile you wish to remove, and click the left mouse button. The tile can only be removed if it is not blocked by another tile.</P>
<P><A name="HTP/OM"><B>Options Menu</B></A></P>
<P>The Options Menu is accessible from the first game selection screen, or by clicking the Menu button while playing the game. The options include: 
<UL>
<LI><B>Music Volume and Sound Effects:</B> you can adjust these volume sliders separately to fit your preferences.</LI>
<LI><B>Fullscreen:</B> If this is checked, Pixelus Deluxe will use your entire computer screen. If it is not checked, Pixelus Deluxe will be played in a window. It’s up to you to decide which you prefer.</LI>
<LI><B>Custom Cursors:</B> If this box is checked, you will see special custom Pixelus Deluxe cursors in the game rather than Windows standard cursors. If you have a special theme installed that changes your Windows cursors, you may need to activate this option to see the game cursor properly.</LI>
<LI><B>Disable Hints and Tooltips:</B> This checkbox turns on or off most of the hint messages in the game. If checked, no hints or tooltips will appear. If unchecked, hints and tooltips will be shown.</LI>
<LI><B>Hardware Acceleration:</B> This box can be checked to improve performance for computers with supported video cards.</LI>
<LI><B>How To Play:</B> This will show you basic instructions on how to play Pixelus Deluxe.</LI>

</UL></P>
<P><A name="HTP/O"><B>Objective</B></A></P>
<P>The objective of Pixelus is to complete the mosaic puzzles in the shortest number of moves possible.  The ‘World Record’ in the left side bar indicates the least number of moves required to complete the current puzzle.</P>
<P><A name="HTP/SAP"><B>Selecting a Puzzle</B></A></P>
<P>The mosaic puzzles are all housed in the temples of the gods. You can select any of the open temples from the Island Map. When you first play Pixelus, only the Tutorial temple is open; once you have completed (or skipped) the tutorial, a new temple will appear on the Island Map. New temples are unlocked after a certain number of mosaics have been completed. There are a total of 9 playable temples, each one more challenging than the last, in addition to the one Tutorial temple. Once you have unlocked a temple, you can play the available puzzles in any order. Each temple also has one mystery puzzle, which can only be unlocked by completing all the other puzzles in the temple.</P>
<P><A name="HTP/H"><B>Hints</B></A></P>
<P>If you are stuck and cannot find a solution to a specific puzzle, you can click on the Hint button. The Hint button allows you to get as many hints as you want. Sometimes all you need to know is where to place your first couple of tiles, and that is often enough to help you figure out the solution. This button is not usable in <A href="#HTP/EM">Expert Mode</A>.</P>
<P><A name="HTP/U"><B>Undo</B></A></P>
<P>The Undo button allows you to undo your moves, one by one. You are not penalized for using the Undo feature. This button is not usable in <A href="#HTP/EM">Expert Mode</A>.</P>
<P><A name="HTP/R"><B>Reset</B></A></P>
<P>Clicking the Reset button will undo all the moves you made while playing that puzzle, returning it to its default starting state.  This does not, however, erase your Personal Best scores.</P>
<P><A name="HTP/M"><B>Medals</B></A></P>
<P>If you complete a puzzle within 10 moves of the World Record, you will be awarded a medal for that puzzle. The World Record for any puzzle is the least number of moves required to complete it. If you match the World Record, then you will earn a Gold medal for that puzzle. If you complete it within 5 moves of the World Record, then you will earn a Silver medal. If you complete it within 10 moves of the World Record, you will earn a Bronze medal. You can always re-select a puzzle to attempt to beat your prior score. When you earn a Gold medal on a puzzle a Timed mode for that puzzle is unlocked, and you can play to beat your best time.</P>
<P><A name="HTP/EM"><B>Expert Mode</B></A></P>
<P>Expert mode is for players who want to complete the game without the aid of the Undo and Hint buttons. Those two buttons are unavailable in this mode – aside from that, the game is the same. To play in Expert mode, create a New User from the Main Menu, and check the ‘Play in Expert mode’ checkbox.</P>
