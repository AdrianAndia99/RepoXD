<p class=header><a name=GET><b>GETTING STARTED</b> </a><a href="#top">[back to top]</a> </p>

<p><a name="GET/PR"><b>Create Your Profile</b></a></p>
<p>When you first launch Peggle World of Warcraft Edition, you will be asked to enter your name on the Peggle Institute Certificate of Admission. Your progress and high scores will be saved when you quit. If there are several people playing on one computer, you will want to create separate profiles for each. To do this, click on the link in Bjorn Unicorn or Splork Sporkan's word balloon that reads, &quot;If this is not you, click here.&quot; A dialog will appear allowing you to select another identity, or create a new one.</p>
<p><a name="GET/SE"><b>Game Selection</b></a></p>
<p>Peggle World of Warcraft Edition has four modes: a sequential story mode (Adventure), a free-select arcade mode (Quick Play), a two-player competitive mode (Duel) and a special Challenge mode (Challenge). At the beginning of the game only Adventure Mode is available; other modes are unlocked as you proceed through the game.</p>
<p><a name="GET/OP"><b>Options</b></a></p>
<p>The Options are accessible from the Main Menu screen, or by clicking the Menu button while playing the game. They are: </p>

<a name="PG"><b>PLAYING THE GAME</b> </a><a href="#top">[back to top]</a>
</p>
<p><a name="PG/GO"><b>Goal</b></a></p>
<p> Peggle World of Warcraft Edition is a game where you try to hit 25 orange pegs with 10 metal balls. You are guiding two Peggle Masters (Bjorn Unicorn and Splork Sporkan) through the magical world of Azeroth, traveling to different Azerothian locales and encountering significant Azerothian characters. Your goal is to safely complete the tour and defeat Arthas the Lich King.</p>

<p><a name="PG/BA"><b>The Basics</b></a></p>
<p>Peggle World of Warcraft Edition is played on a Peggle board. The majority of the board is taken up by an array of pegs. At the top of the board is a Launcher, which you control. You aim the Launcher by moving the mouse cursor, and you fire it by clicking the left mouse button. Firing the Launcher shoots a Peggle ball that bounces around the board lighting up each peg it hits until falling off the bottom of the board. The lit pegs then disappear and you can take another shot.</p>
<p>You begin each level with ten balls. Light up the 25 orange pegs scattered randomly around the board to complete the level and achieve Extreme Fever.</p>

<p><a name="PG/CO"><b>Controls</b></a></p>
<p>The controls for Peggle World of Warcraft Edition are simple: move your mouse cursor to the point where you want the ball to go. The Launcher will automatically aim to follow your mouse cursor.</p>
<p>Click the left mouse button to fire a Peggle ball. The ball will head to where the tip of the cursor was when you clicked.</p>
<p>You can hold down the right mouse button any time the ball is not in play to speed up the motion of the Free Ball Bucket and any moving pegs. This is helpful when waiting for moving objects.</p>
<p>You can also use the mouse wheel or the left and right arrow keys to make small angle adjustments. This is useful for getting the exact shot that you want. Hitting the Enter key will fire the ball. </p>

<p><a name="PG/PE"><b>Pegs</b></a></p>
<p>Pegs can be round or rectangular. If rectangular, they are sometimes called bricks.</p>
<p>Pegs come in four colors:
<ul>
<li><b>Blue (Standard peg):</b> These make up the vast majority of the pegs on the board.<br>Base value: 10 points.
<li><b>Orange (Goal peg):</b> There are 25 orange pegs per level, and they must all be lit in order to complete the level.<br>Base value: 100 points (10x blue).
<li><b>Purple (Point peg):</b> The purple peg is worth 50x the value of the blue pegs. There is one purple peg per turn and its location changes every shot. Purple pegs appear for the first time on the fourth level.<br>Base value: 500 points (50x blue).
<li><b>Green (Magic peg):</b> Hitting a green peg activates a Peggle Magic Power, either immediately or on the next shot (see <a href="#PG/PM">Peggle Masters and Magic Powers</a>, below). There are two green pegs per level. Green pegs appear for the first time on the third level. <br>Base value: 10 points (1x blue).
</ul>
</p>

<p><a name="PG/BT"><b>Ball-o-Tron</b></a></p>
<p>On the left side of the Peggle board is the Ball-o-Tron. The number at the top of the Ball-o-Tron shows how many balls you have left, and the balls themselves sit in the hopper underneath. You begin each level with 10 balls: 9 in the Ball-o-Tron and one pre-loaded in the Launcher at the top of the screen.</p>

<p><a name="PG/FM"><b>Fevermeter</b></a></p>
<p>On the right side of the Peggle board is the Fevermeter. As you eliminate orange pegs, the Fevermeter lights up. As you hit certain points on the Fevermeter, a score multiplier takes effect that increases the point value of your pegs. For a more detailed description of the score multiplier, see <a href="#SC/SH">Shot Scores</a> in the <a href="#SC">Scoring</a> section below.</p>

<p><a name="PG/FR"><b>Free Balls</b></a></p>
<p>Though you begin each level with 10 balls, there are several ways to earn Free Balls during play.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Free Ball Bucket:</b> The Free Ball Bucket moves back and forth across the bottom of the screen. If your ball lands in the Bucket it will be returned to the Ball-o-Tron for another shot.<br>You can speed up the Free Ball Bucket's motion while the ball is not in play by holding down the right mouse button, but once you've taken your shot you cannot directly control the Free Ball Bucket. You can, however, time your shot so that it has a greater chance of hitting the Free Ball Bucket. This is a key skill.<br>It is also possible to time your shot so that it hits the side of the Free Ball Bucket and bounces back into play. This is an essential skill for hitting hard to reach pegs.
<li><b>25k Shot Score:</b> As the ball bounces down the board it earns points for the shot (see <a href="#SC/SH">Scoring</a>, below). As the shot score rises the glass tubes on the sides of the Ball-o-Tron begin to fill up with green light. The green light reaches the top once the shot score reaches 25,000 points, and you are awarded a Free Ball.
<li><b>75k Shot Score:</b> If a shot score reaches 25,000 points and continues to climb, the Ball-o-Tron tubes will begin to fill with purple light. If the shot score reaches 75,000 points, you will be awarded a second Free Ball.
<li><b>125k Shot Score:</b> If a shot score reaches 75,000 points and continues to climb (it's possible!), the Ball-o-Tron tubes will begin to fill with yellow light. If the shot score reaches 125,000 points, you will be awarded a third Free Ball.
<li><b>Coin Flip:</b> If you don't hit any pegs on a shot, the Free Ball coin spins and you may be awarded a Free Ball.
</ul>
</p>

<p><a name="PG/EF"><b>Extreme Fever</b></a></p>
<p>Hitting the last orange peg on a level completes the level and activates Extreme Fever. The screen zooms in on the ball, time slows down, and the words &quot;Extreme Fever&quot; zestfully appear. You can click the left mouse button to end slow-motion mode and return to normal speed. </p>
<p>Blue and green pegs struck after Fever has been activated earn 1000 points each. Hitting a purple peg after Fever earns 10,000 points. </p>
<p>After activating Fever, the ball will continue on its way until falling into one of five bonus point areas that appear on the bottom of the board; from left to right their values are 10,000, 50,000, 100,000, 50,000 and 10,000 points. </p>

<p><a name="PG/UEF"><b>Ultra Extreme Fever</b></a>
<p>If you clear all the pegs on a level you will activate Ultra Extreme Fever. In that case all the five bonus point areas will award 100,000 points, and you will win a special All Pegs Cleared ribbon for that level. Rumor has it that a secret rank of Peggle Mastery awaits one who can get All Pegs Cleared ribbons for every Peggle board.</p>

<p><a name="PG/PM"><b>Peggle Masters and Magic Powers</b></a></p>
<p>Peggle World of Warcraft Edition features two Peggle Masters. The Masters watch your play from above the Launcher, and each of them has a special Magic Power that is activated when you hit the green peg. Some Magic Powers activate immediately, while others take effect on your next shot. The number above the Peggle Master's head shows how many shots remain on the Magic Power.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Super Guide</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Master:</b> Bjorn Unicorn
<li><b>Effect:</b> The Super Guide greatly extends the aiming line to show the path the ball will take through one bounce. Note that the ball does not travel in a straight line; instead, its path is curved as a result of the effect of gravity on the ball's motion. Use the Super Guide to get a sense of exactly how you should place your mouse cursor to get a specific shot. Though not as flashy as some of the later Magic Powers, mastering the Super Guide is the foundation of all Peggle skills.
<li><b>Activation:</b> Takes effect on next shot.
<li><b>Duration:</b> Three shots.
</ul></p>

<p><b>Space Blast</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Master:</b> Splork
<li><b>Effect:</b> The Space Blast creates an explosion that lights up all pegs within slightly more than a four peg-width radius from the green peg. This is useful for clearing whole areas of the board, and you can boost your shot score by waiting until you can catch the purple peg in a Space Blast.
<li><b>Activation:</b> Takes effect immediately.
<li><b>Duration:</b> Instant.
</ul></p>

</blockquote>

<p><a name="PG/SS"><b>Style Shots</b></a></p>
<p>Certain kinds of cool shots will earn special recognition and bonus points. These bonus points add to your overall level score but do not add directly to your shot score (and thus do not help in earning a Free Ball). However, they do contribute to your score in Duel Mode as well as towards the scoring Challenges. All style shots require that you hit at least one peg.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Free Ball Skills:</b> Bounce ball directly from one (and only one) peg into the Free Ball Bucket.<br>Points: 5,000 (2,500 in Duel Mode)
<li><b>Long Shot:</b> Hit a non-blue peg, travel approximately 1/3 the width of the screen, hit another non-blue peg next or almost-next.<br>Points: 25,000 (5,000 in Duel Mode)
<li><b>Double Long Shot:</b> Hit a non-blue peg, travel approximately 1/3 the width of the screen, hit another non-blue peg next or almost-next, then travel approximately 1/3 the width of the screen to hit a third non-blue peg next or almost-next.<br>Points: 25,000 (10,000 in Duel Mode)
<li><b>Super Long Shot:</b> Hit a non-blue peg, travel approximately 2/3 the width of the screen, hit another non-blue peg next or almost-next.<br>Points: 50,000 (10,000 in Duel Mode)
<li><b>Off the Wall:</b> Bounce the ball off of the wall, travel approximately 1/5 the width of the screen, and hit a non-blue peg.<br>Points: 25,000 (5,000 in Duel Mode)
<li><b>Kick the Bucket:</b> Bounce the ball off the Free Ball Bucket and hit the final orange peg for Fever.<br>Points: 25,000 (5,000 in Duel Mode)
<li><b>Lucky Bounce:</b> Bounce the ball off the Free Ball Bucket for a certain amount of time or 1/4 the height of the screen, then catch the ball in the Free Ball Bucket.<br>Points: 25,000 (2,500 in Duel Mode)
<li><b>Mad Skillz:</b> Have 5 balls in a row fall in the Free Ball Bucket.<br>Points: 25,000 (5,000 in Duel Mode)
<li><b>Crazy Mad Skillz:</b> Have 10 balls in a row fall in the Free Ball Bucket.<br>Points: 100,000
<li><b>Extreme Slide:</b> Slide for 12 pegs.<br>Points: 50,000 (5,000 in Duel Mode)
<li><b>Orange Attack:</b> Given a number of orange pegs remaining, hit a certain number of orange pegs in a shot:<br>
<blockquote><table>
<tr>
<td width="30%"><u>Orange Remaining</u></td><td width="60%"><u>Pegs to Hit</u></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4 or fewer</td><td>no Orange Attack</td>

</table>
</blockquote>
Points: 50,000 (5,000 in Duel Mode)
<li><b>Cool Clear:</b> Get Ultra Extreme Fever (100% pegs cleared) on a shot that hits at least two pegs.<br>Points: 50,000
<li><b>Bucket Bonus:</b> Have a ball fall into the Free Ball Bucket (Duel Mode only).<br>Points: 2,500 for first drop, increases by 2,500 each time
<li><b>Mega Shot Bonus:</b> Reach 25,000, 75,000 or 125,000 points on a shot (Duel Mode only).<br>Points: 2,500 at each tier

<blockquote>

<b>Super Guide</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Double Guide:</b> Hit both green pegs in the same shot, resulting in the Super Guide being active for the next six shots.<br>Points: 25,000
</ul>

<b>Space Blast</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Big Bang:</b> Light up both green pegs in the same shot, either by hitting them both with the ball or by catching one green peg in the Space Blast of the other.<br>Points: 25,000
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="PG/RE"><b>Replays</b></a></p>
<p>Instant replays are useful for reliving your favorite shots and showing them to your friends and family over and over again. </p>
<p>Click the Instant Replay button on the bottom right of the screen to see a replay of your last shot. Right-click the Instant Replay button to enable an advanced mode in which you can replay all shots for a game. </p>
<p>During a replay you can hold down the left mouse button in the play area to activate slow motion. Holding down the right mouse button will activate fast forward.</p>
<p>You can save replays and view them later. During the replay, click the Save button on the lower right side of the screen. This will bring up a dialog box that allows you to enter a name for the shot. When you're done watching your replay, click the Done button on the lower right corner of the screen. To view saved replays, click the Replay button on the Main Menu. </p>
<p>You can e-mail friends your saved shots and receive saved shots from your friends. To view them, open the Replays and then click the Open Folder Button. This will open a folder and will show you the replay installation location. You can attach replays to e-mails from this folder, and you can drop replays from your friends into this folder. View them by clicking the Replay button on the Main Menu. </p>
<p>Replays can also be activated by double-clicking them on your desktop, or by dragging-and-dropping them into an open Peggle World of Warcraft Edition window.</p>

<p class="header">
<a name="GM"><b>GAME MODES</b> </a><a href="#top">[back to top]</a>
</p>

<p><a name="GM/AM"><b>Adventure Mode</b></a></p>
<p>Adventure Mode is the primary mode, and it allows you to accompany Bjorn and Splork in their Azeroth expedition. Progress through all the levels to become a Peggle Master yourself. Adventure Mode is divided into 2 stages made up of five levels (or boards) each. The first stage is presided over by Bjorn; the second by Splork. The stages and levels are:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Stage 1 - Bjorn Unicorn (Super Guide)</b>
<ul>
<li>1.1 - Wanted: Hogger
<li>1.2 - Valley of Heroes
<li>1.3 - Deep Breath
<li>1.4 - Too Soon, Executus
<li>1.5 - The Dark Portal
</ul></p>

<p><b>Stage 2 - Splork (Space Blast)</b>
<ul>
<li>2.1 - Arcane Affinity
<li>2.2 - Prince Sunstrider
<li>2.3 - The Betrayer
<li>2.4 - Ley of the Land
<li>2.5 - The Traitor King
</ul></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Once you have completed Adventure Mode you may replay it at any time, and you will be allowed to use Bjorn or Splork on any level. Try to beat your high score!</p>

<p><a name="GM/QM"><b>Quick Play Mode</b></a></p>
<p>Quick Play Mode lets you select individual levels to play. You can also hit the Random button in the lower right corner of the screen to have an individual level selected for you. You may only play levels that you have completed in Adventure Mode, and you may only use Peggle Masters that you have unlocked in Adventure Mode. However, unlike in Adventure Mode, you are free to use any Peggle Master that you have unlocked and not just the one associated with a particular level.
</p>

<p><a name="GM/DM"><b>Duel Mode</b></a></p>
<p>Duel Mode is unlocked once you have completed Stage 1 of Adventure Mode. Duel Mode allows you to compete in a two-player version of Peggle World of Warcraft Edition on any board you have completed in Adventure Mode. You can play against the computer or another person. The computer opponent has four difficulty settings: Easy (good for beginners); Normal (a well-rounded Duel Mode experience); Hard (for some extra challenge); and Master (the ultimate test for ultimate Peggle Masters).
</p>

<p>Duel Mode has slightly different rules than the single player modes. In Duel Mode, two players take turns shooting the ball. You must hit at least one orange peg on a shot; if you don't then you are penalized by losing 25% of your level score.</p>

<p>Each player starts the game with 6 balls. Generally, there are no Free Balls in Duel Mode. If you get a ball in the Free Ball Bucket you will not receive a Free Ball; instead, you will receive a point award in the form of a Bucket Bonus style shot. Each time a player gets this style shot, the point value of this shot will increase for the next player to get it. Scoring 25,000, 75,000 or 125,000 points on a shot, while awesome, will also not award you a Free Ball in Duel Mode, but will award a modest point bonus to recognize achieving one of the three point thresholds. Furthermore, players are also not awarded a coin flip Free Ball in Duel Mode.</p>

<p>The two green pegs appear one at a time rather than both together. When one is hit, the other will appear randomly on the board on the next shot.</p>

<p>The game ends either when a player eliminates the last orange peg or when both players run out of balls. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.</p>

<p><a name="GM/CM"><b>Challenge Mode</b></a></p>
<p>Challenge Mode is unlocked once you have completed Adventure Mode. Challenge Mode presents you with extra difficult Peggle feats. There are 10 challenges, broken into 2 stages of 5 challenges each. They are:</p>
<blockquote>

<p><b>Test Your Skills!:</b> Challenges of Azerothian valor!
<ul>
<li>1.1 - By Fire Be Pegged! (beat Deep Breath board with 55 orange pegs)</li>
<li>1.2 - Destiny Awaits (beat The Dark Portal board staying under 150,000 points)</li>
<li>1.3 - Duel Spec'd (beat Bjorn in a Master difficulty duel on The Traitor King board)</li>
<li>1.4 - Phat Lewtz (score 300,000 points on The Betrayer board with 300,000 starting with only 7 balls)</li>
<li>1.5 - 1-Shot Kill (beat Wanted: Hogger board with only 1 ball)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Level 60 Challenges:</b> Even more tests of legendary skill!
<ul>
<li>2.1 - Dreaded Rep Grind (score 250,000 Style Shot points on the Valley of Heroes board)</li>
<li>2.2 - Slideways Glance (get 3 Extreme Slide shots on Arcane Affinity board)</li>
<li>2.3 - Fear Phase Five (get 5 Free Ball Skills shots on Prince Sunstrider board)</li>
<li>2.4 - Pwnyxia (score over 400,000 points on By Fire Be Purged! board)</li>
<li>2.5 - Epic Quest Chain (beat Too Soon, Executus, Deep Breath, Prince Sunstrider, The Betrayer and The Traitor King boards all in a row)</li>
</ul></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Every challenge you beat earns you a special Peggle Master wreath. Beat all of the challenges to boost your Peggle Master rank and win a trophy.</p>

<a name="SC"><b>SCORING</b> </a><a href="#top">[back to top]</a>
</p>
<p><a name="SC/SH"><b>Shot Score</b></a></p>
<p>The base value for a blue peg is 10 points.<br>
The base value for an orange peg is 100 points.<br>
The base value for a purple peg is 500 points.<br>
The base value for a green peg is 10 points.</p>

<p>Every peg you hit on a shot adds to a subtotal score. The shot score is the subtotal score multiplied by the number of pegs hit. It doesn't matter in which order the pegs are hit.</p>

<p>Example 1: On your first shot you hit blue (10), orange (100), blue (10), blue (10), orange (100), orange (100), green (10), purple (500) and blue (10). Your subtotal score would be 850 points (10 + 100 + 10 + 10 + 100 + 100 + 10 + 500 + 10). You hit 9 pegs, so your shot score would be 7,650 points (850 points x 9 pegs).</a>

<p>The value of all pegs goes up as orange pegs are eliminated. The Fevermeter on the right side of the board shows the current score multiplier.</p>

<p>Example 2: You've already hit 13 orange pegs and there are 12 remaining. You shoot and hit blue, blue, orange, orange, orange, purple, orange, blue, blue and orange. The second orange peg you hit would bump the multiplier up from 2x to 3x, so the subtotal score would be 20 (blue @ 2x) + 20 (blue @ 2x) + 200 (orange @ 2x) + 300 (orange @ 3x) + 300 (orange @ 3x) + 1500 (purple @ 3x)+ 300 (orange @ 3x) + 30 (blue @ 3x) + 30 (blue @ 3x) + 300 (orange @ 3x) for a subtotal of 3,000 points. You hit ten pegs, so your final shot score would be 30,000 points (3,000 points x 10 pegs).</p> 

<p><a name="SC/FS"><b>Fever Score</b></a> (Points earned on last shot)<br>
Final shot points + Bonus Hole points + Extra Ball Bonus</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Shot points:</b> Hitting the final orange peg sets off Extreme Fever. Scoring for the last shot taken is calculated the same way as other shot points (subtotaled value of pegs hit x number of pegs hit). Blue or green pegs hit after Fever are worth 1,000 points each; the purple peg is worth 10,000 points.

<li><b>Bonus Holes:</b> At the end of Fever, the ball drops into one of five Bonus Holes on the bottom of the screen. The Bonus Holes are worth, from left to right, 10k, 50k, 100k, 50k and 10k points.<br>If you achieve <b>Ultra Extreme Fever</b> by clearing all pegs, the bonus holes will all award 100,000 points.

<li><b>Extra Balls:</b> You receive 10,000 points per extra ball left over.

</ul>
<p>Note: Magic Powers can be active or activated during Fever (e.g. if Multiball is active, both balls will score points for landing in Bonus Holes).</p>

<p><a name="SC/SP"><b>Style Points</b></a>
<p>As previously mentioned in the <a href="#PG/SS">Style Shots</a> section above, certain cool shots earn additional points. These points do not contribute to earning Free Balls, but they do add to your level score. Style shots score differently in Duel Mode than in the other modes, and some style shots cannot be done in Duel Mode.</p>

<p><a name="SC/LS"><b>Level Score</b></p>
<p>The level score is all shot scores + Fever score + style points, and it is displayed in the score bar to the upper left of the Ball Launcher.</p>

<p><a name="SC/TS"><b>Total Score</b></p>
<p>The total score is a running tally of your level scores, and it is displayed in the score bar to the upper right of the Ball Launcher.</p>

<p>In Adventure Mode, if you finish a level on your first try, you get 100,000 additional points added to your total score; on your 2nd try, 50,000 points; on your 3rd try, 25,000 points; on your 4th or more tries, no bonus points.</p>

<p>In addition, you receive a 10,000,000 point bonus if you complete Adventure Mode without losing a level. This end-of-mode bonus is reduced by 200,000 points each time you require an additional attempt to complete a level.</p>

<p><a name="SC/DM"><b>Duel Mode Scoring</b></a></p>
<p>The peg values in Duel Mode are the same as in Adventure Mode, as is the point multiplier and the method of calculating shot scores (subtotaled value of pegs x number of pegs hit).</p>
<p>Unlike in Adventure or Quick Play, the Bonus Holes in Duel are worth, from left to right, 5,000, 25,000, 50,000, 25,000 and 5,000 points. There is no Ultra Extreme Fever in Duel Mode, and the bonus for extra balls left over is 5,000 points instead of 10,000.</p>

<p><a name="SC/AS"><b>Ace Scores</b></a></p>
<p>Each board has an associated Ace Score. Beating this score in Adventure or Quick Play modes earns an Ace Score ribbon on that board in the Quick Play menu. Achieving Ace Scores in all the boards earns an Ace Score Trophy.</p>

<p><a name="SC/ST"><b>Stats</b></a></p>
<p>Clicking the Stats button on the Main Menu accesses a Stats screen.</p>
<p>The High Scores section lists 10 all-time high scores in Adventure mode over all profiles, with preset scores to beat.</p>
<p>The Your Best Scores section lists the 10 best Adventure scores for the current profile.</p>
<p>The Your All-Time Stats section lists the number of shots, Free Balls and Style Shots for the current profile, the Best Shot and Best Fever scores for the current profile, the number of Challenges finished for the current profile, the number of levels 100% cleared for the current profile and the number of Ace Scores achieved for the current profile.</p>
<p>The Current Adventure Stats section lists the number of shots, Free Balls and Style Shots for the current Adventure of the current profile; the Best Shot, Best Fever and total scores for the current Adventure of the current profile; the number of retried levels for the current Adventure of the current profile and the number of Loading Screen fairies clicked for the current profile.</p>

<a name="GT"><b>GAMEPLAY TIPS</b> </a><a href="#top">[back to top]</a>
</p>

<p><a name="GT/BT"><b>Basic Tips</b></a><br>
<li>The ball will head to the exact position of the tip of your mouse cursor when you fire.<br>
<li>Use the mouse wheel or arrow keys to aim more precisely.<br>
<li>Hold down the right mouse button to speed up time.  This is helpful when waiting for a specific shot.<br>
<li>Peg values go up as the number of orange pegs decreases.  The Fevermeter on the right indicates the current point multiplier.<br>
<li>When pegs are worth 10x, you can score over 25,000 points by hitting the purple peg and at least four other pegs.<br>
<li>Clear all of the pegs on a level to get Ultra Extreme Fever!</p>

<p><a name="GT/GT"><b>General Tips</b></a><br>
<li>Aiming for a higher orange peg is usually a good strategy since you might hit the lower ones later on in the shot.<br>
<li>Sometimes you can get a hard-to-reach peg by bouncing off the wall.<br>
<li>You can try to get a Free Ball on every turn by estimating where the ball will land and timing your shot with the Free Ball Bucket accordingly.  You won't get it every time, but it can't hurt!<br>
<li>Clear blue pegs out of the way to get to orange pegs. If you have enough balls left, it's easier to spend a shot clearing a blue peg rather than trying a crazy bank shot.<br>
<li>The purple peg is great for a point boost, but don't get too distracted by it. Points are good, but not as good as clearing the level.<br>
<li>If you have extra balls left near the end of a level, try some crazy shots to improve your Peggle skills!<br>
<li>If you're having trouble with the Challenge levels, try using different Peggle Masters. Some Magic Powers are dramatically more effective for certain challenges than others.<br>
<li>For advanced players, try to keep as many blue pegs on screen as you can until you've got only a couple of orange pegs left; then combo a purple peg with as many blue pegs as you can for BIG point bonuses.<br>
<li>Practice with Bjorn, practice with Bjorn, practice with Bjorn.</p>

<p><a name="GT/MST"><b>Master-Specific Tips</b></a></p>
<p><blockquote>
<b>Bjorn (Super Guide)</b><br>
<li>Use the mouse wheel or arrow keys to more precisely aim the Super Guide.<br>
<li>Use Bjorn's Super Guide to build familiarity with how the ball bounces and the path it takes. Ideally you should be able to imagine the Super Guide without it even being there.<br>
<li>Use the Super Guide to pick out and practice useful shots like the Long Shot, the Super Long Shot and the Free Ball Skills shot.<br>
<li>Use the Super Guide to hit the purple peg after getting Fever.<br>
<li>Use the Super Guide to aim for the 100,000 point hole during Fever.<br>
<li>The Super Guide tends to be more useful later in the level when the board's not so crowded.<br><br>

<b>Splork (Space Blast)</b><br>
<li>Tag the purple point peg with the Space Blast for extra points.<br>
<li>Try leaving a cluster of pegs near the green peg alone, then hit it with the Space Blast when your multiplier is up.<br>
