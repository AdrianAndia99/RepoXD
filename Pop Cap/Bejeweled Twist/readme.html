<p class=header><a name=GET><b>GETTING STARTED</b> </a><a href="#top">[back to top]</a> </p>

<p><a name="GET/PR"><b>Create Your Profile</b></a></p>
<p>When you first launch Bejeweled Twist, you will be asked to enter your name. Your progress and high scores will be saved when you quit. If there are several people playing on one computer, you will want to create separate profiles for each. To do this, click on the &quot;Change User&quot; button on the main menu. A dialog will appear allowing you to select another identity, create a new one or delete an old one.</p>

<p><a name="GET/SE"><b>Game Selection</b></a></p>
<p>Click &quot;Play&quot; on the main menu to access the game selection screen. Bejeweled Twist has four game modes: Classic (in which you face bombs, locks and doom gems), Zen (like Classic, but you can't lose), Challenge (a set of unusual Twist puzzles), and Blitz (a 5-minute timed version of Classic). At the beginning of the game only the Classic and Zen modes are available; Challenge and Blitz are unlocked as you proceed through the game.</p>

<p><a name="GET/OP"><b>Options</b></a></p>
<p>The Options are accessible from the Main Menu screen, or by clicking the Menu button while playing the game. They are:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Music:</b> This slider sets the volume of in-game music, and can be adjusted to fit your preference.</li>
		<li><b>Sounds:</b> This slider sets the volume of all non-music sound effects, and can be adjusted to fit your preference.</li>
		<li><b>3D Acceleration:</b> This box can be checked to improve performance for computers with supported video cards.</li>
		<li><b>Custom Cursors:</b> If this box is checked, you will see special custom Bejeweled Twist cursors in the game rather than Windows standard cursors. If you have a special theme installed that changes your Windows cursors, you may need to activate this option to see the cursor properly in the game.</li>
		<li><b>Fullscreen</b><b>:</b> If this is checked, Bejeweled Twist will use your entire computer screen. If it is not checked, Bejeweled Twist will be played in a window. The window can also be resized by clicking and dragging its lower right corner.</li>
		<li><b>Visualizers</b><b>:</b> If this is checked, the various Bejeweled Twist visualizer patterns will animate in the background as you play. If it is not checked, the visualizers will be replaced with static backgrounds.</li>
		<li><b>Show Hints</b><b>:</b> If this is checked, occasional sparkles on the board will indicate twists you may make. If it is not checked, the hints will not appear.</li>

<p class="header">
<a name="PG"><b>PLAYING THE GAME</b> </a><a href="#top">[back to top]</a>
</p>
<p><a name="PG/GO"><b>Goal</b></a></p>
<p>The goal of Bejeweled Twist is to score as many points as possible by matching gems before succumbing to a Bomb Gem.</p>

<p><a name="PG/BA"><b>The Basics</b></a></p>
<p>Bejeweled Twist is played on a board containing an 8 x 8 grid of gems. Surrounding your cursor is the Gem Rotator, a silver ring that encloses a 2 x 2 square of gems. Clicking the mouse button twists the gems in the Rotator one clockwise step. When three or more gems of the same color make a line, they disappear. The gems above them fall to fill the spaces of the vanished gems, and more gems fall in from the top of the board to fill the grid.</p>
<p>To the left of the gem board is the Levelup Tube. As you make matches, the Tube fills up. Filling the Tube warps you to the next level with a new grid of gems.</p>

<p><a name="PG/CN"><b>Controls</b></a></p>
<p>The controls for Bejeweled Twist are simple: move the Rotator around the board with your mouse cursor. Click the left mouse button to twist the gems in the Rotator one clockwise step. It's not necessary to make a match in order to twist gems.</p>
<p>There are also non-mouse controls for Bejeweled Twist. Use the arrow keys to move the Rotator and Spacebar/Enter to rotate.</p>

<p><a name="PG/GE"><b>Gems</b></a></p>
<p>There are seven different basic types of gem: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, white and violet. All gems match and score identically.</p>

<p><a name="PG/CA"><b>Cascades</b></a></p>
<p>When gems are matched, they vanish, causing the gems above them to fall and take their places. If those gems also make matches, they too will vanish, creating a cascade of matches. 

<p><a name="PG/LT"><b>Levelup Tube</b></a></p>
<p>To the left of the gem board is the Levelup Tube. As you match gems, the Tube fills up with glowing energy. When the Tube is full you warp to the next level and a new grid of gems.</p>
<p>The segmented meter at the top of the Tube shows your current Score Multiplier (see <a href="#PG/CH">Chains & Score Multiplier</a>)</p>
<p>The white number just below the Score Multiplier shows your current score.</p>
<p>The yellow number on the rising ring that encircles the Tube shows your current level.</p>
<p>The four gem icons which appear near the bottom of the Tube after the first level show the current Bonus Challenge sequence (see <a href="#PG/BC">Bonus Challenge</a>).</p>

<p><a name="PG/CH"><b>Chains & Score Multiplier</b></a></p>
<p>While you are always able to make non-matching twists, each consecutive matching twist adds to a chain. As the chain grows longer, the Chain Meter at the top of the Tube fills up. Each time you fill the meter, the Score Multiplier increments upwards, multiplying all your points by the Multiplier. Every time you go up one level in the Score Multiplier, the Chain Meter starts with one mark already filled in</p>
	
	<blockquote>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td width="40%"><u>Multiplier</u></td><td width="60%"><u>Matching Twists to next Multiplier</u></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1x</td><td>4</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2x</td><td>8</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>3x</td><td>12</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>4x or higher</td><td>16</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	</blockquote>
	
<p>A non-matching twist breaks the chain and empties the meter to the bottom of the current Multiplier. Another non-matching twist reduces the Multiplier by one. Thus, excessive non-matching twists can rapidly deplete the Score Multiplier. On the other hand, once a new Multiplier level has been attained, it is possible to alternate match/non-match twists to stay at the same Multiplier level.</p>
<p>When the Score Multiplier is at 10x, filling the Chain Meter no longer increases your Multiplier. However, extending the chain fills the Chain Meter up with pulsing rainbow lights. If you fill this rainbow Chain Meter, your Score Multiplier does not increase, but a bolt of energy flies out from the Tube and converts one of your Locked, Bomb or Doom Gems into a Fruit Gem (see <a href="#PG/FR">Fruit Gems</a>). After doing this your Score Multiplier resets to the very bottom of x10 with a single mark in the Chain Meter.</p>

<p><a name="PG/FL"><b>Flame Gems and Lightning Gems</b></a></p>
<p>Matching four gems in a row, or using the same gem to match two sets of three in an L, T or plus sign shape, combines the gems into a powerful Flame Gem. When a Flame Gem is matched, it explodes and destroys itself plus the eight gems surrounding it.</p>
<p>Matching five gems in a row combines the gems into a super-powerful Lightning Gem. When a Lightning Gem is matched, it sends bolts of energy up, down, left and right, destroying all the gems in its row and column.</p>
<p>Flame Gems can set off Lightning Gems and other Flame Gems; Lightning Gems can do the same. This allows for chain reactions of astonishing force.</p>
<p>If you complete a level with Flame or Lightning Gems still on the board, they will accompany you to the next level.</p>
<p>Rumor has it that it is possible to create a super-powerful &quot;Supernova Gem&quot; by matching 6 gems in a line. Rumor says this extraordinary gem combines the powers of Flame and Lightning Gems.</p>

<p><a name="PG/CO"><b>Coal</b></a></p>
<p>Coals are inert rocks that cannot be matched. However, they can be destroyed with Flame Gems or Lightning Gems, releasing valuable Geodes inside. Coals are destroyed at the end of each level.</p>

<p><a name="PG/LO"><b>Locked Gems</b></a></p>
<p>Starting at level 4, every so often a small swinging padlock icon will appear on a gem. If this gem is not matched, it will become a Locked Gem on the next turn. Locked Gems cannot be twisted. However, they can be matched like any other gem, or destroyed by Flame or Lightning Gems.</p>
<p>There can be no more than 8 Locked Gems on any board. Locked Gems are destroyed at the end of each level.</p>
<p>Locked Gems do not appear in Zen mode.</p>

<p><a name="PG/BG"><b>Bomb Gems</b></a></p>
<p>Starting at level 2, Bomb Gems will begin to appear. Bomb Gems have dull metallic outer casings and a large number on the front. The number counts down every time you twist, regardless of whether you make a match or not. If the number counts down to zero, a warning klaxon will sound and you will be given an opportunity to disarm the bomb (see <a href="#PG/DS">Disarm Spinner</a>). Bomb Gems can be twisted and matched like any other gem, or destroyed by Flame or Lighting Gems. Locked Gems are destroyed at the end of each level.</p>
<p>Bomb Gems do not appear in Zen mode.</p>

<p><a name="PG/DS"><b>Disarm Spinner</b></a></p>
<p>When a Bomb Gem counts down to zero, a klaxon sounds, the screen zooms in to the Bomb Gem, and the Disarm Spinner activates. There are eight gems on the spinner, two of which will change to skull symbols. The spinner then spins, and the player may click the stop button to stop the spinner. If the spinner stops on the skull icons, the game is over. If the spinner stops on a pair of gems, the game continues. You will then be returned to the gem board and 6 twists will be added to any other Bomb Gems on the board.</p>
<p>Each time a Bomb Gem counts down to zero, the Disarm Spinner is activated with another two gems replaced with skull icons. This means that the first time you encounter the Disarm Spinner, you have a 3 in 4 chance of continuing your game; the second time a 2 in 4 chance; and the third time a 1 in 4 chance. After 3 Bomb Gems have counted down and activated the Disarm Spinner, any additional use of the Disarm Spinner will give you a 1 in 4 chance of continuing your game.</p>
<p>The Disarm Spinner only appears in Classic mode. Bomb Gems do not appear in Zen mode, and in Blitz mode, any Bomb gem that counts down to zero immediately ends your game.</p>

<p><a name="PG/DM"><b>Doom Gems</b></a></p>
<p>Starting at level 13, some gems spontaneously become Doom Gems. Doom Gems have a heavy, spiked outer casing and a number on the front. They cannot be matched, but they can be destroyed by Flame or Lightning Gems. Like Locked Gems, Doom Gems cannot be twisted. Like Bomb Gems, Doom Gems have a counter. However, unlike Bomb Gems that count down on every twist, Doom Gems only count down on non-matching twists. Doom Gems are destroyed at the end of each level.</p>
<p>Doom Gems do not appear in Zen Mode</p>

<p><a name="PG/FR"><b>Fruit Gems</b></a></p>
<p>Fruit Gems are created by maxing out the Score Multiplier (filling the Chain Meter twice at a 10x Multiplier). When a Fruit Gem is matched, it emits a pulse of energy that explodes all gems of the same color, breaks all locks and adds 10 twists to any Bomb Gems on the board. It also activates the Mega Fruit Bonus (see <a href="#PG/BC">Bonus Challenge</a>).</p>

<p><a name="PG/BC"><b>Bonus Challenge</b></a></p>
<p>Starting with level 2, the bottom of the Tube opens up and reveals the Bonus Challenge. The Bonus Challenge section shows four gem types. Matching those types in sequence activates the Bonus, which greatly boosts the Chain Meter.</p>
<p>Matching a Fruit Gem activates the Mega Fruit Bonus. The Mega Fruit Bonus works the same way as a regular bonus, but you are rewarded with more points, a greater Multiplier boost and a spectacular Fruit dance.</p>

<p><a name="PG/RA"><b>Ranks</b></a></p>
<p>As you complete levels in Classic or Zen modes, challenges in Challenge mode or games in Blitz mode, you earn stars. Stars fill up your Rank Bar in between levels, and when the Rank Bar is full, you earn a new Rank. Your current rank appears above your username on the Main Menu.</p>

<p><a name="PG/RE"><b>Replays</b></a></p>
<p>After a particularly good move, the Instant Replay button may appear at the bottom of the gem board. Click this button to watch your sweet move again and again. When you're finished rewatching your replay, make another twist to dispell the Replay button.</p>


<p class="header">
<a name="GM"><b>GAME MODES</b> </a><a href="#top">[back to top]</a>
</p>
<p><a name="GM/CM"><b>Classic Mode</b></a></p>
<p>Classic Mode is the basic Bejeweled Twist play mode, and is available at the beginning of the game. Twist gems to make matches while destroying Locked Gems, Bomb Gems and Doom Gems.</p>
<p><a name="GM/ZM"><b>Zen Mode</b></a></p>
<p>Zen Mode is a stress-free mode of Bejeweled Twist, and is available at the beginning of the game. Locked, Bomb and Doom gems do not appear. Thus, you cannot lose. Max out your Score Multiplier and earn as many points as you like!</p>
<p>Moves in Zen Mode earn points at half the rate of Classic Mode.</p>
<p>Completing levels in Zen Mode earns stars at half the rate of Classic Mode.</p>
<p><a name="GM/BM"><b>Blitz Mode</b></a></p>
<p>Blitz Mode is a timed version of Classic Mode, good for a quick taste of twisting action. It is unlocked once you finish level 10 in Classic or Zen Modes. In Blitz you have five minutes to score as many points as possible. You do not level up in Blitz Mode; the whole 5 minutes takes place on one board. Locked Gems and Bomb Gems appear in this mode.</p>
<p>Moves in Blitz mode earn points at 2.5x the rate of Classic Mode.</p>
<p><a name="GM/CH"><b>Challenge Mode</b></a></p>
<p>Challenge Mode is a special set of unique Bejeweled Twist puzzles. It is unlocked when you reach Rank 3.</p>
<p>The Challenge puzzles have goals instead of points, Chain Meters or Score Multipliers. In other words, they are "free-twist"; there are no penalties for non-matching twists (except for Survivor).</p>
<p>There are 13 classes of puzzle; each class has 7 puzzles plus a special Eclipse puzzle that is unlocked when you beat the others. They are:</p>

<p class="header">
<a name="SC"><b>SCORING</b> </a><a href="#top">[back to top]</a>
</p>
<p>There are two kinds of scoring in Bejeweled Twist: points and stars. <i>Points</i> are awarded for twisting gems to make matches in Zen, Classic and Blitz Modes. <i>Stars</i> are awarded for completing levels in Zen and Classic Modes, Blitz games in Blitz Mode, and Challenges in Challenge Mode.
</p>

<p><a name="SC/PO"><b>Points</b></a></p>
<p>In Bejeweled Twist, a <i>move</i> is one click of the mouse. A move may make no matches (thus scoring no points), a single match with no further matches coming from cascades (thus scoring match points and possibly bonus and coal points), or a match with further matches coming from cascades (thus scoring match and cascade points and possibly bonus and coal points).
</p>

<p><a name="SC/MP"><b>Match Points</b></a></p>
<p>The simplest way to earn points in Bejeweled Twist is to make matches. The base values for these matches are as follows:
</p>

	<blockquote>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td width="80%"><u>Gems in a line</u></td><td width="20%"><u>Points<u></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>3</td><td>50</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>4</td><td>100</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>5 or more</td><td>200</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	</blockquote>

<p>Note that L, T and plus-shapes act as two 3-matches. Longer intersecting matches are treated in a similar manner.</p>

<p><a name="SC/CP"><b>Cascade Points</b></a></p>

<p>Next, we have cascade bonuses. Cascade bonuses are awarded each time gems drop and make another match, and are added directly to the points awarded for each cascading match. The longer the cascade continues and the more matches are made, the more bonus points are earned for each new match.</p>

	<blockquote>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td width="80%"><u>Cascade</u></td><td width="20%"><u>Points</u></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1</td><td>0</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2</td><td>50</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>3</td><td>100</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>4</td><td>150</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>5</td><td>200</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>6</td><td>300</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>7 or more</td><td>400</td>
		</tr>	
	</table> 
	</blockquote>

<p>Note that in the chart above, "Cascade: 1" represents a player-made match with no subsequent matches from gems dropping in. The "cascade" is simply the gems dropping in, without matching, to fill the empty space.</p>

<p><a name="SC/BP"><b>Bonus Points</b></a></p>
<p>In addition to these basic point scores, there are many bonuses.</p>

	<table border="1">
		<tr>
			<td width="40%"><b>Special Gem</b></td><td width="60%"><b>Points</b></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>L, T or plus-shape<br>(creates Flame Gem)</td><td>50 per shape. Must be one of these exact shapes. Longer intersecting matches do not award this bonus.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Flame Gem</td><td>100 per detonation</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Lightning Gem</td><td>300 per detonation<br>20 per gem zapped, including the Lightning Gem itself</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Fruit Gem</td><td>1000 for matching<br><br>After triggering:
			<ul>
				<li>20 per normal gem destroyed</li>
				<li>200 per Flame Gem destroyed</li>
				<li>300 per Lightning/Supernova Gem destroyed</li>
				<li>2000 per Fruit Gem destroyed</li>
			</ul>
			All locks destroyed, 10 turns added to Bomb/Doom Gems
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Locked Gem</td><td>0 (No bonus for clearing a Locked Gem)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Bomb Gem</td><td>100<br>1 added to Chain Meter (in addition to the 1 added for the match itself)</td>
		</tr>	
		<tr>
			<td>Doom Gem</td><td>1000<br>10 added to Chain Meter</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Speed Bonuses</td>
			<td>Speed Bonus: 1000 (6 fast matches in a row)<br>
			Hyperspeed Bonus: 2000 (12 fast matches in a row)<br>
			Gigaspeed Bonus: 4000 (18 fast matches in a row)</td>
		</tr>
	</table> 

<p><a name="SC/CO"><b>Coal Points</b></a></p>
<p>When a coal is broken, it releases 1 to 4 geodes. Over the course of a move, the geodes from broken coals are worth a gradually increasing number of base value points like so:</p>

	<blockquote>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td width="80%"><u>Geode #</u></td><td width="20%"><u>Points</u></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1</td><td>200</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2</td><td>300</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>3</td><td>400</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>4</td><td>500</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>5</td><td>600</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>6 or more</td><td>700</td>
		</tr>	
	</table>
	</blockquote>

<p>So, if you destroy two coals in one move, and the first coal releases 2 geodes while the second releases 3, then the base values for those 5 geodes would be worth 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 points, or 2000 total coal points for the move.</p>

<p><a name="SC/FD"><b>Fruit Dance</b></a></p>
<p>The Fruit Dance is activated by completing the Mega Fruit Bonus that appears after matching or destroying a Fruit Gem.</p>
<p>The only multiplier that affects these points is the Mode Multiplier (see <a href="#SC/MU/MM">Mode Multiplier</a>).</p>
<p>Classic awards 71500 points.<br>
Zen awards 35750 points.<br>
Blitz awards 178750 points.<br></p>
<p>In addition, a Fruit Gem is awarded at the end of the dance.</p>
	
<p><a name="SC/MU"><b>Multipliers</b></a></p>
<p>There are three types of multipliers: Score Multiplier, Simultaneous Match Multiplier and Mode Multiplier.</p>

	<blockquote>

	<p><a name="SC/MU/SM"><b>Score Multiplier</b></a></p>
	<p>The Score Multiplier, as incremented through the Chain Meter (see <a href="#PG/CH">Chains and Score Multiplier</a> above), applies globally to all match, cascade, bonus and coal points for any given move.</p>

	<p><a name="SC/MU/SMM"><b>Simultaneous Match Multiplier</b></a></p>
	<p>If more than one match occurs either by the same twist or at the same stage of a cascade, then the points for those matches receive the following multipliers:</p>

		<blockquote>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td width="80%"><u>Number of simultaneous matches</u></td><td width="20%"><u>Multiplier</u></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td></td><td></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2</td><td>both x2</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>3 or more</td><td>all x3</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		</blockquote>

	<p>Thus, if you make two matches with one twist, you will receive double the points for those matches you would normally receive. If more gems fall in and three more matches occur simultaneously, then all those matches will receive three times the points they normally would.</p>

	<p><a name="SC/MU/MM"><b>Mode Multiplier</b></a></p>
	<p>In addition to the above two multipliers, the Mode Multiplier applies globally to all points scored in a given mode, as follows:</p>

		<blockquote>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td width="50%"><u>Mode</u></td><td width="50%"><u>Multiplier</u></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Classic</td><td>x1 (base values)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>Zen</td><td>x0.5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Blitz</td><td>x2.5</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		</blockquote>

	<p>Thus, all the point values listed above hold for Classic Mode. In Zen Mode, all those point values are divided by 2. In Blitz Mode, all those values are multiplied by 2.5.</p>

	</blockquote>


<p><a name="SC/ST"><b>Stars</b></a></p>
<p>In addition to points, as you play Bejeweled Twist you also earn stars. Stars accumulate over the course of all game modes, and as you earn more stars your rank increases.</p>
<p>Stars are awarded in different game modes as follows:</p>

<p><b>Classic Mode</b></p>
<p>Every time you complete a level, you receive a number of stars equal to the level number you completed. After the first level you get 1 star, after the second you get 2 stars, after the third you get 3 stars, and so on.</p>

<p><b>Zen Mode</b></p>
<p>Every time you complete a level, you receive a number of stars equal to the level number you completed divided by two and rounded up. After levels 1 and 2 you get 1 star, after levels 3 and 4 you get 2 stars, after levels 5 and 6 you get 3 stars, and so on.</p>

<p><b>Blitz Mode</b></p>
<p>Blitz stars are awarded according to a mysterious twistological algorithm. Play better and score more points to earn more stars.</p>

<p><b>Challenge Mode</b></p>
<p>As you complete challenges, you receive stars. The higher the challenge number of any challenge type, the more stars you receive, like so:</p>

	<blockquote>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%"><u>Challenge #</u></td><td width="50%"><u>Stars Awarded</u></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1</td><td>5</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2</td><td>8</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>3</td><td>11</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>4</td><td>14</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>5</td><td>17</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>6</td><td>20</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>7</td><td>23</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	</blockquote>

<p>Completing Eclipse challenges awards stars in another mysteriously algorithmic fashion. The better you do, the more stars you earn.</p>

<p><a name="SC/STS"><b>STATS</b></a></p>
<p>When you complete a game of Classic or Blitz, a stats screen will appear with information about your game. The Stats window lists:
	<ul>

<a name="GT"><b>GAMEPLAY TIPS</b> </a><a href="#top">[back to top]</a>
</p>

<p><a name="GT/BT"><b>Basic Tips</b></a><br></p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Watch for sparkles; they show you potential matches.</li>
		<li>Watch for patterns in the gems... an 'L' shape can usually match.</li>
		<li>Complete two gem sets at once for a point bonus.</li>
		<li>Make six good moves without pause to earn a Speed Bonus.</li>
		<li>Try to get your Score Multiplier up as quickly as possible by making chains.</li>
		<li>The Multiplier only drops a level if you miss a move when it's empty.</li>
		<li>Keep the Score Multiplier going by alternating matching and matchless moves.</li>
		<li>Max out the Chain Meter twice to earn super-rare Fruit Gems.</li>
		<li>Fruit Gems clear all like-colored gems and have special powers.</li>
		<li>Match Bomb Gems with gems of the same color before they tick down.</li>
		<li>Bomb Gems can be destroyed by Flame or Lightning Gems.</li>
		<li>Destroying Bomb Gems adds matches to your Chain Meter.</li>
		<li>Blow Coals apart with Flame or Lightning Gems to get the Geodes inside.</li>
		<li>Each detonated Coal releases one to three bonus Geodes.</li>
		<li>Blow up multiple Coals at once to increase your Geode bonus.</li>
		<li>Explode several Coals with a big Multiplier for a massive boost.</li>
		<li>Remember: finishing a level clears Locks, Bombs, and Doom Gems from the board.</li>
		<li>You earn Rank Stars at different rates in each game mode.</li>
		<li>Doom Gems only count down when you move without making a match.</li>
		<li>Only one Doom Gem can appear per level, and it typically appears around the halfway mark.</li>
		<li>It's possible to make a 6-gem match... or even a 7- or 8-gem match.</li>
		<li>Match 6 gems in a row to create a super-powered gem.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p><a name="GT/BT"><b>Advanced Tips</b></a></p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Take note of the transitions between Score Multipliers. When you've just increased your Multiplier, you have one free non-matching twist before your Multiplier drops. If you're careful, you can alternate match/non-match twists to set up a better board.</li>
		<li>If you have multiple matches available and you're working on maintaining a chain, work from the top down; that way you won't disrupt the lower matches when you make the higher ones.</li>
		<li>Keep an eye on the Bonus Challenge sequence. It's not easy, but if you get a chance it will greatly boost your Score Multiplier.</li>
		<li>Be aware of how much more of the level you have to complete. Often, particularly if your Score Multiplier is up, you can complete a level before Bomb Gems get a chance to count all the way down.</li>
		<li>Generally speaking, hang on to your Flame, Lightning and Fruit Gems as long as you can, as they are very helpful when you get in a jam.</li>
		<li>Not only do Fruit Gems destroy all gems of the same color on the board when matched, but they also add 10 turns to all Bomb Gems.</li>
		<li>Locked and Doom Gems announce themselves one twist before they appear. You can use this to put them in a more advantageous position, i.e. away from the edge or next to an exploding gem or a gem of the same color.</li>
		<li>You don't have to destroy Bomb Gems as soon as they appear; you just have to get them before they explode. Keep them in mind as you play, but you don't have to take direct action until their counters get down to 4 or 5 or so.</li>
		<li>Play Zen Mode and Challenge Mode to get a feel for how to create Flame and Lightning Gems.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p><a name="GT/BT"><b>Blitz Tips</b></a></p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>A top score in Blitz requires clever use of chains and multipliers.</li>
		<li>Try to store up as many explosive gems as possible until late in the game; you will earn far more points if you can detonate them all at once when your Score Multiplier is up.</li>
		<li>Treat the game like you're going for a Speed Bonus; as you're making one match, find the next one on the board.</li>
		<li>Be aggressive; don't worry so much about the Bombs.</li>
		<li>If at all possible, go for the Fruit.</li>
		<li>Try to keep an "escape hatch"; that is, a match you can make near the bottom of the board. When things get tight you can match it to shake up the board.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p><a name="GT/GT"><b>Challenge Tips</b></a></p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>If you get stuck on one Challenge type, move on to the next.</li>
		<li>When working on multiple detonations, create your exploding gems and then move them to the side away from your "work space" so as not to trigger them ahead of time.</li>
	</ul>
