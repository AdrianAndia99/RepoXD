1.0 REQUIRED SPEC / MINIMUM SPEC
================================

1.1 REQUIRED SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

ATOMICA Deluxe requires an IBM PC or 100% compatible computer,
with a Pentium II 300 Mhz or better processor. Your computer must have
at least 64 megabytes of RAM.

Operating System: you must be utilizing Windows 95, 98, 2000, ME, or XP
with DirectX 7 or later to play ATOMICA Deluxe on your system.

Controls: a keyboard and a 100% Microsoft compatible mouse are required.

Sound: you must have a DirectX certified sound card installed.

Video: you must have your desktop set to 16-bit or 32-bit Color
(256 Colors will not work).


1.2 RECOMMENDED SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

PopCap® recommends an IBM PC or 100% compatible computer, with a
Pentium II 500 Mhz or better processor.


===================================
2.0 TROUBLESHOOTING / COMPATIBILITY
===================================

For updates to this list go to www.popcap.com.

2.1  DirectX®

Atomica requires you to have DirectX 7 drivers installed.
These are sound and video drivers from Microsoft used in
many games. If you need the latest version of DirectX, go to
http://www.microsoft.com/directx.

2.2  Screen Color Depth

Atomica requires you to be running in 16bit color or better. It
may not function in Windowed mode properly in 256 colors. If you
are running in 256 colors, the game will try to switch to full
screen mode.

In addition, the game may run slowly in windowed mode in 32 bit
color. If this occurs, switch to full-screen mode, or change
your color depth to 16 bits.

2.3  Bug Reporting

Though we've tried our best to squash all the bugs, every once in
a while something we didn't expect pops up...

If you should come across a bug in Atomica, please report it to
bugs@popcap.com.

If for some reason the program crashes, it will try to capture any
pertinent data and give you instructions on how to send that data
to PopCap. This is very helpful for tracking down glitches! This 
information is also stored in a file called CRASH.TXT in your
Dynomite directory (C:/PROGRAM FILES/POPCAP GAMES/ATOMICA by
default). If you can, include this text file with any email you
send to PopCap about crashes.


===================
3.0 GETTING STARTED
===================

3.1 GOAL

The goal of Atomica is to create MOLECULES by moving ATOMS around
the Game Grid. New atoms will continue to appear, and when you
can no longer make any moves, the game will end. 

3.2 GAME TYPES

After the game loads, you will see a screen allowing you to choose
Strategy mode or Action mode. If you have a saved game, you will
also see the option to continue that saved game. There is also the
option to quit back to Windows.

3.3 STRATEGY MODE

This is similar to the web version of Atomica. You can take as long
as you like to make each move.

When you quit out of Strategy mode, your game will automatically be
saved. You can continue it the next time you play by choosing Classic
mode again.

3.4 ACTION MODE

Action Mode is a new version of Atomica that plays in real-time. It is
best suited to experienced players who want a fast-paced exciting game!

In Action mode, new atoms continually appear on the board, whether you
are moving a piece or not.

As in Strategy, your game is automatically saved whenever you quit, and
can be continued by selecting Continue Saved Game the next time you play.

3.5 EXPERT MODES

On the right of each bar is a small button reading "Click Here for Expert
Mode." This will let you play Strategy or Action in an advanced mode,
suitable for experienced players. The game is much more difficult, but
you will also score many more points.

================
4.0 INSTRUCTIONS
================

4.1 CONTROLS

Atomica is controlled entirely with the mouse. To move an atom, simply
click on it, then click on the square you want to move it to.

An arrow will appear connecting the two squares if it is a valid move.
You can move atoms anywhere on the board, but they cannot pass through
other atoms... so some areas of the board will be blocked off as the
game progresses and more atoms appear.

If you decide you want to move a different atom than the one you've
selected, just click on the other atom and it will be selected.

Bonus Molecules can be moved like other atoms, but they must be
DOUBLE-CLICKED to activate their special powers. Doing so will destroy
the Bonus Molecule, however.

4.2 GAMEPLAY

You must arrange atoms on the grid to form molecules. A molecule is
formed when 4 atoms of the same color are arranged in a 2x2 square.

You can also form a double molecule by arranging 6 molecules of the
same color in a 2x3 rectangle.

When a molecule is formed, those atoms will merge together and 
disappear from the board, getting sucked down into the Vortex.
  
4.3 NEW ATOMS

New atoms will appear on the board every time you move and DO NOT
complete a molecule. Usually, 3 new atoms will appear with each move.

You can tell where these new atoms are going to appear by looking
for the NUCLEUS SYMBOLS on the board. These glowing shapes indicate
where new atoms are about to form, and what color they will be. Use
this information to plan your moves!

4.4 COMBOS

An important part of the game is learning how to score COMBOS. These
will make you lots of extra points, and can help charge your ATOMIC
BOMB.

A combo is created when you finish two or more molecules in a row.
That is, you complete a molecule and then with your very next move,
complete another. If you can complete a third molecule after that, it's
called a Super Combo. Four atoms in a row is a Mega Combo, and so on.

The more molecules in your combo, the higher the point bonus. Also,
higher level combos will charge up your Atomic Bomb, which can be used
to destroy atoms on the board. Learn how to "set up" combos so they
can be maximized!

The GEIGER COUNTER at the top of the screen will get progressively
more agitated as you make bigger combos.

4.5 ATOMIC BOMB

At the bottom of the screen you will see the Atomic Bomb button and
meter. When the Atomic Bomb is charged, the glass cover on the button
will slide up, allowing you to press the button and detonate the bomb.

Detonating the Atomic Bomb will destroy a number of random atoms on 
the grid. The higher the Bomb's charge is, the more atoms will be
destroyed.

The Bomb gets charged by completing Combos!

4.6 MOLECULE METER

This meter is located at the top of the screen. Whenever you complete
a molecule, it will fill up a bit. To progress to the next level, you
must fill it all the way up. 

In Action mode, the meter works a bit differently. It fills up on its
own, and when it is completely filled, a new color of atom is added to
the grid, making the game more difficult.


====================
5.0 SPECIAL FEATURES
====================

There are several special atoms and events you will come across as you
play.

5.1 BONUS MOLECULES

After you have created a number of atoms, you will see the Bonus Molecule
window swing out on the left sidebar. This will display a special molecular
configuration you can complete to get a Bonus Molecule.

You must arrange atoms on the board so that they match the configuration
shown in the Bonus Window. If you do so, they will merge into a brand new
Bonus Molecule. Bonus Molecules do not combine with other atoms, but they
can be moved around the board like a regular atom.

To trigger a Bonus Molecule's powers, DOUBLE-CLICK on it. This will destroy
the Bonus Molecule in the process.

There are 5 different types of Bonus Molecule. Each has a different effect.
In addition, if you keep the Bonus Molecule on screen for a while, you'll
get the chance to combine it with other atoms into a Level 2 Bonus Molecule.
These have even greater powers.

Level 3 Bonus Molecules? If they exist, they'd have astonishing abilities...

5.2 CHROMIUM ATOMS

You may occasionally see a strange reflective atom appear on the grid.
These are CHROMIUM atoms. They basically act as wildcards.

A Chromium atom will take on the characteristics of any atom it is next to.
So you can use one to complete any molecule with 3 other colored atoms, for
instance.

Chromium atoms cannot, however, be used to complete Bonus Molecules.

5.3 BIOHAZARDS

Occasionally you will see Biohazard atoms appear on the grid... these
pulsating atoms will have a countdown printed on their side. 

Biohazards are very dangerous, because they replicate. With each move,
the countdown will tick down, and when it reaches zero, the Biohazard
will duplicate itself, spawning a new Biohazard atom in an adjacent
square. This new Biohazard will also begin counting down... if you're
not careful, they can quickly choke off the board!

Biohazards can be eliminated by making them into a molecule, as with
any normal colored atom.

5.4 RADIATION ROUNDS

After a certain number of levels, you will see your first Radiation
Round. This is a bonus round where you are challenged to remove all
the atoms from the screen. If you can do so, you'll receive a bonus.

5.5 MAGNET ROUNDS

These are special levels that occasionally occur, in which the atoms
will all "fall" to one side or another of the grid, drawn by a
powerful magnet. This artificial "gravity" makes your job much trickier.

5.6 OTHERS?

Keep your eyes out for other special rounds as you play!

===========
6.0 OPTIONS
===========

You can access various options for Atomica Deluxe by clicking the 
Options button on the sidebar.

6.1 MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS

You can raise or lower the volume for either of these independently
by moving the respective slider. To turn music or sound off, move
the slider all the way to the left.

6.2 FULLSCREEN MODE

You can play Atomica in either windowed or full-screen mode. To 
toggle between the two, click on the checkbox next to Fullscreen.

You may see faster performance in full-screen mode, depending on
your system.

6.3 COLORBLIND FIX

Colorblind players may have difficulty distinguishing atoms from
one another. Turning on this option will put Atomic Symbols on
each atom.

6.4 DISABLE HINTS

This will disable the hints that normally appear when you first
play the game. You can also disable these by clicking "Don't Show
Me This Again" on each hint.

6.5 RESET HINTS

If you want to reset all the hints (for instance, if a new player
is trying the game on your computer), click this button.

6.6 HIGH SCORES

Click this to see the high scores list for Action and Strategy
modes.

6.7 REGISTER

6.8 CREDITS

===========
7.0 SCORING
===========

You receive 80 pts for each Molecule you create.

Combos will increase this by the level of the combo. A basic combo is
worth 80 additional points. The next combo in the sequence is worth an additional
160 points, the next 240 and so on.

For creating Bonus Molecules, you receive 100pts multiplied by the level
of the bonus molecule.

For completing the first Radiation Round, you receive 500 points. You
get 1000 points for the second, 1500 for the third, and so on.

If you're playing in Expert mode, all point values are doubled.
