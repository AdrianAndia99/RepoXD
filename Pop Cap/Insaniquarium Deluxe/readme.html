<p class=header><a name=HP><b>HOW TO PLAY</b> </a><a href="#top">[back to top]</a>
</p>

<p><a name="HP/I"><b>Introduction</b></a></p>
<p>Feed fish! Fight aliens! This spectacular action-puzzle adventure is the
craziest aquarium you’ve ever seen! Buy fish, win pets, and unlock lots of
hidden secrets while you explore this captivating underwater world. Then
stock your Virtual Tank with custom fish to create your own private
screensaver!</p>
<p>As a new player, you start with Adventure mode to earn pets and unlock
tanks, then move on to Time Trial mode and, once you are an expert, Challenge
mode! You can play Virtual Tank any time, but if you want to spend more than
the 200 shells you are given, you'll want to earn shells in the other modes.</p>
<p><a name="HP/CP"><b>Create Your Profile</b></a></p>
<p>When you first launch Insaniquarium Deluxe, you
will be asked for your name. Your progress and high scores will be saved when
you quit. If there are several people playing on one computer, you will want
to create separate profiles for each person. To do this, click on the link at
the top of the screen that reads, &quot;If this is not you, click here.&quot;
A dialog will appear allowing you to select another identity or create a new
one.</p>
<p><a name="HP/GC"><b>Game Controls</b></a></p>
<p>Click in the fish tank to drop food for your fish to eat. As the fish eat
and grow they will drop coins, and new fish and upgrades become available.
When aliens appear, click on them to shoot them with your laser weapon. You
can click next to an alien to deflect it in the opposite direction. For
example, if you click just above an alien, it will start moving lower. Use
this trick to maneuver the aliens away from your fish!</p>
<p><a name="HP/O"><b>Objective</b></a></p>
<p>Your objective in each level of Insaniquarium is
to collect enough money to buy 3 egg pieces. When you have purchased all
three egg pieces, you will be rewarded with a new pet to add to your
collection. To earn money, buy and feed fish so they will grow and drop money.
Bigger fish drop more valuable coins. Click on the coins, gems, or other
valuable items your fish drop. Watch out for aliens, who appear from time to
time to eat your fish. Use the money you collect to buy new guppies, fish
food upgrades, weapon upgrades and other items to help you win the level
faster.</p>
<p><a name="HP/OM"><b>Options Menu</b></a></p>
<p>The Options Menu is accessible from the first Main Menu screen, or by
clicking the Menu button while playing the game. They include: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Music
Volume and Sound Effects:</b> you can adjust these volume
sliders separately to fit your preferences.
<li><b>Fullscreen</b><b>:</b>
If this is checked, Insaniquarium Deluxe will
use your entire computer screen. If it is not checked, Insaniquarium Deluxe will be played in a window.
It’s up to you to decide which you prefer.
<li><b>Custom
Cursors:</b> If this box is checked, you
will see special custom Insaniquarium Deluxe
cursors in the game rather than Windows standard cursors. If you have a
special theme installed that changes your Windows cursors, you may need
to activate this option to see the cursor properly in the game.
<li><b>Hardware
Acceleration:</b> This box can be checked to
improve performance for computers with supported video cards.
<li><b>Help:</b>
This will show you basic instructions on how to play Insaniquarium
Deluxe. 
</ul>
<p><a name="HP/A"><b>Adventure</b></a></p>
<p>Adventure mode is the first mode you will play. There are four tanks; Each
one has different fish and aliens, and each requires the player to adopt new
strategies to win.</p>
<p>Each tank is comprised of five levels. To beat a level, you need to buy
three egg pieces (click on last icon in the top row to buy an egg piece).
When you buy three egg pieces, a new pet will hatch. You can only have up to
three pets to help you on a given level, so once you have discovered more
than three pets, you will need to choose your best three before each level
begins.</p>
<p>Each pet has different skills that can help you, and some are more suited
for certain situations. If you are having a hard time beating a level, experiment
with different pet combinations to see which pet combo works best.</p>
<p><a name="HP/BR"><b>Bonus Rounds</b></a></p>
<p>During a Bonus Round, lots of shells will drop - click on them and collect
as many as you can before time runs out. If you
click on multiple shells of the same type in a row, you will earn
successively more shells for each click. Use the shells you collect to buy
the Bonus Pets, fish from the Virtual Tank store, and other upgrades. The
first time you play Adventure mode, you will get to play 3 Bonus Rounds. When
you have finished Adventure mode, it becomes Bonus Adventure mode, with bonus
rounds after each level.</p>
<p><a name="HP/TT"><b>Time Trial</b></a></p>
<p>Once you have completed a tank in Adventure mode, that tank becomes
unlocked in Time Trial mode. The objective in Time Trial is to collect as
much money as you can in a fixed amount of time. Each tank is limited to 10
minutes, except Tank 1 which has a 5-minute time limit. The pets and strategy
you choose for each tank will have a big effect on how much money you can
collect. Choose pets that will help you get money quickly during the early
part of the game, as this will allow you to upgrade to higher paying fish
faster.</p>
<p>There are no egg pieces to buy in Time Trial mode, but you can buy extra
pets to help you. The pets you buy will be randomly chosen, so if you want to
risk it, you can spend some of your hard earned money to buy helper pets
during the level. You can only buy pets you have already discovered in
Adventure mode, but aside from that, you can buy as many pets as you want to
help you out. Just keep in mind that they start getting very expensive.</p>
<p>As a bonus for each time you complete a Time Trial tank, you are awarded
shells equal to 5% of the money you have when the time runs out.</p>
<p><a name="HP/CH"><b>Challenge</b></a></p>
<p>Challenge mode is not for the weak of heart and
is only unlocked once you have finished Adventure mode. Challenge mode has
four tanks, each one progressively harder. The objective of Challenge mode is
to finish each tank as fast as you can, while at the same time trying to deal
with increasingly difficult alien attacks, and rising prices!</p>
<p>The prices of all items begin to rise as soon as they become available,
and keep on rising. When you buy an egg piece, all prices will reset to their
starting levels, except the price of the egg pieces, which keep rising till
you buy all three egg pieces to complete the level.</p>
<p>Try to finish as quickly as possible, because the alien attacks will
become more ferocious as time goes on.</p>
<p>You are rewarded with shells each time you finish a Challenge tank. You
get 2,000 shells each time you complete Challenge tank 1; 5,000 for tank 2;
10,000 for tank 3; and a whopping 20,000 for tank 4.</p>
<p><a name="HP/VT"><b>Virtual Tank</b></a></p>
<p>The Insaniquarium Virtual Tank is your own
personal aquarium. The first thing you should do is go to the Store, where
you can buy fish, tank upgrades, and new backdrops. You are given 200 shells
to begin with, and you can earn more as you play the other three game modes.</p>
<p>Fish you buy in the Virtual Tank will never die, but you should feed them
to keep them happy. A fish requires three pieces of food per day to stay
completely happy. Many fish eat normal fish food, which you can drop by
clicking in the tank. But some fish, such as Carnivores and fish with
'special diets,' must be fed by clicking on the Feed button.</p>
<p>If you buy a fish and decide you would rather spend your shells on
something else, you can always sell it. Click on the Fish button, select the
fish you want to sell, and then click Sell. If you sell a fish on the same
day you buy it, you get a full refund. After that, the resale value will be
lower.</p>
<p>At the top of the Virtual Tank screen is a bar with several important
buttons. </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Store:</b>
This takes you to the Fish Emporium, where you can buy fish and other
goodies for your tank.
<li><b>Fish:</b>
Click the Fish button to manage your fish collection. Here you can
rename or sell fish, hide fish if your tank is getting too crowded, or
even find out more about each fish you own, such as their mood,
hometown, and hobbies.
<li><b>Pets:</b>
You can also add your pets to your Virtual Tank by clicking the Pets
button.
<li><b>Feed:</b>
This button only shows up if you have fish that don't eat normal fish
food. This allows you to feed these fish. To feed regular fish, just
click in the tank to drop food.
<li><b>Tank:</b>
Click on the Tank button to change various Virtual Tank settings, such
as changing backdrops, turning off fish names, enabling the screensaver,
etc.
</ul>
<p><a name="HP/VTO"><b>Virtual Tank Options</b></a></p>
<p>The Virtual Tank options are available from the Tank button inside Virtual
Tank mode.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Show
Fish Names:</b> By default, the names of the
fish in your tank will be displayed underneath each fish. Uncheck this
option if you don't want the names displayed.
<li><b>Show
Bubbulator:</b> Once
you have bought the Bubbulator from the Store,
you can hide it any time by un-checking this option.
<li><b>Show
Alien Attractor:</b> Once you have bought the
Alien Attractor from the Store, you can hide it any time by un-checking
this option. Aliens will not appear if the Alien Attractor is hidden.
<li><b>Allow
Fish To Drop Shells:</b>
Uncheck this box if you do not want your fish to drop shells in Virtual
Tank.
<li><b>Always
Show When Fish Are Hungry:</b> Fish only need to be fed
three pieces of food per day, and after that they will no longer appear
hungry till the next day. Check this option if you want your Virtual
Tank fish to always display when they are hungry.
</ul>
<p><a name="HP/VTS"><b>Virtual Tank Screensaver</b></a></p>
<p>You can use your Virtual Tank as your computer screensaver. Because
Virtual Tank fish drop shells, any shells collected while the screensaver is
running will be added to your Shell balance. Make sure you add pets that feed
your fish (like Zorf the Seahorse) since hungry
fish do not drop shells. And don't forget to add a pet that collects money
and shells (like Stinky the Snail), otherwise shells
dropped by your fish while the screensaver is running will not be collected.</p>
<p>To set up your Insaniquarium screensaver, click
on the Tank button in Virtual Tank and then click the Screensaver... button.
Check the box labeled Enable Screensaver and click OK.</p>
<p>There are a few options for the screensaver. </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Allow
Monitor Powersave Mode:</b>
Check this option if you want your keep your monitor powersaving
setting enabled while the Insaniquarium
screensaver is running. This option is off by default. Some computers,
especially older systems, may have problems when this option is enabled.
If you enable this option and experience any problems, turn it off or
disable your Insaniquarium screensaver.
<li><b>Enable
Sound:</b> Check this if you want the
sound effects to play while the screensaver is running.
<li><b>Rotate
Backdrops:</b> Check this if you want the
screensaver to cycle through all the tank backdrops you have purchased
in the Store.
<li><b>Periodically
Darken Screen:</b> Check this if you want the
screensaver to go dark at regular intervals.
<li><b>Show
Collected Shells:</b> Check this if you would like
the screensaver to display how many shells have been collected while the
screensaver has been running.
</ul>
<p>To disable the screensaver from within the game, select Tank options in
Virtual Tank, click on Screensaver... and uncheck the Enable Screensaver
button.</p>
<p>To disable the screensaver from the Windows Desktop, just perform the
following three steps: </p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click
on a blank area of your Windows Desktop and select 'Properties' to show
the Display Properties dialog.
<li>Click
on the Screen Saver tab.
<li>From
the drop-down list under the 'Screen saver' heading, select a different
screensaver or select [NONE], then click OK to confirm the choice.
</ol>

<p><a name=GT><b>GAMEPLAY TIPS</b> </a><a href="#top">[back to
top]</a> </p>

<p><b>Prego sound:</b> Some people are annoyed by the sound Prego makes when
a baby is born. To change this sound, type 'prego' (without
the quotes) in any tank and an alternate sound will be played whenever Prego
has a baby. Type 'prego' again if you want the old
sound back.</p>
<p><b>Fighting aliens:</b> As soon as an alien appears, try to coax it away
from your fish by firing your laser next to it. Clicking to the left of an
alien will force it to go to the right, clicking just above an alien will
force it to move down.</p>
<p><b>Alien immune to lasers:</b> One alien is immune to your laser weapon!
But, his stomach is his weakness, so use food to get rid of him.</p>
<p><b>Star Potion:</b> Only large guppies can eat the Star Potion. Small and
Medium guppies will die if they eat it. Wait till you see a hungry large
guppy, then buy and drop a Star Potion right in front of it to make sure no
other fish accidentally eats it. Once a large guppy has eaten a Star Potion,
it will drop stars, which the Star Catchers need to stay alive.</p>
<p><b>Dropping Food:</b> When you have upgraded your food quantity, you can
click and hold down your mouse button to auto-feed.</p>
<p><b>Replaying Insaniquarium:</b> After you have
finished the Adventure game, you can replay it and use any of the pets in any
level. But if you want to replay the game in order to win all the pets again,
you will need to create a new User Profile from the Main Menu. Just click on
'If this is not you, click here' link under the Welcome message and create a
new user.</p>
<p><b>Screensaver Tips:</b> Did you know you can collect shells while your
screensaver is running? Just make sure you have the following in your Virtual
Tank: some fish to drop shells, a pet that feeds your fish, and a pet that
collects shells. You can even see how many shells have been collected while
your screensaver is running by enabling 'Show Shells Collected' in Virtual
Tank Options.</p>
<p><b>Time Counter:</b> If you want to see the elapsed time in any Adventure
or Challenge tank, just type 'time' and it will be displayed in the lower
right corner. Type 'time' again if you want the time display to go away.</p>
<p><b>Virtual Tank Refund:</b> If you buy a fish in the Virtual Tank Store
and don't like it, you can get a full refund if you sell it back on the same
day you bought it. Just click on the Fish button in Virtual Tank, select your
fish, and click Sell. When you hover your mouse pointer over the sell button,
the refund price of the fish will be displayed.</p>
<p><b>Double-click to hide/show fish:</b> You can quickly hide or show a fish
from the Virtual Tank's Fish screen by double-clicking on it.</p>
<p><b>Having a hard time in Challenge?</b> Challenge mode can be very
difficult, and the key to winning is choosing the right combination of pets,
defending against the aliens, and making sure you get as much money as
quickly as possible. This will enable you to buy the more expensive options
faster. If you are close to buying an egg piece, try to put off purchasing
fish or upgrades for a short while, since all prices get reset as soon as you
purchase an egg piece (except the price of the egg pieces, which continues to
rise). Challenge tanks 3 and 4 are very tricky and you may need to buy and
use some or all of the Bonus Pets to help you win.</p>
<p><b>Bonus Round Tip:</b> You can get extra points for consecutively
clicking on the same type of shell. This is useful when you see a lot of the
same shell type on the screen, especially the more valuable shells.</p>
<p><b>Need Shells?</b> You can earn shells in a variety of ways. Shells can
be collected during the Bonus Rounds in Adventure mode, shells are awarded
after each Time Trial and Challenge game, the fish you buy in your Virtual
Tank drop shells, even when the screensaver is running (as long as you have
feeding and shell-collecting pets in your tank).</p>
<p><b>Scaring fish:</b> Right-clicking on your Virtual Tank can scare some of
the fish. You don't want to do that, do you?</p>
<p><b>Challenge mode:</b> In the Challenge tanks, alien attacks get more ferocious
the longer you play, so try to finish each tank as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><b>PsychoSquid</b><b> tip:</b> Stop shooting PsychoSquid when he is blue, otherwise he will regain
health. Use that time to coax him away from your fish by shooting next to
him.</p>
<p><b>Transferring Shells:</b> If you have collected more shells than you can
possibly spend, you can give them to another user! At the Main Menu, type
'give' (without the quotes) and you will see a dialog listing all the other Insaniquarium user profiles that have been created on
your computer. Click on the user you want to give shells to, then enter how
many shells you want to transfer. Click OK to finalize the transfer. You can
create a new user profile from the Main Menu by clicking on 'If this is not
you, click here'. By creating an extra profile, you can quickly start a new
Virtual Tank using shells you have transferred from another profile.</p>
