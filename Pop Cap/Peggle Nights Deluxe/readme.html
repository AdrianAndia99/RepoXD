<p class=header><a name=GET><b>GETTING STARTED</b> </a><a href="#top">[back to top]</a> </p>

<p><a name="GET/PR"><b>Create Your Profile</b></a></p>
<p>When you first launch Peggle Nights, you will be asked to enter your name on the Peggle Institute Certificate of Admission. Your progress and high scores will be saved when you quit. If there are several people playing on one computer, you will want to create separate profiles for each. To do this, click on the link in Bjorn Unicorn's word balloon that reads, &quot;If this is not you, click here.&quot; A dialog will appear allowing you to select another identity, or create a new one.</p>
<p><a name="GET/SE"><b>Game Selection</b></a></p>
<p>Peggle Nights has four modes: a sequential story mode (Adventure), a free-select arcade mode (Quick Play), a two-player competitive mode (Duel) and a special Challenge mode (Challenge). At the beginning of the game only Adventure Mode is available; other modes are unlocked as you proceed through the game.</p>
<p><a name="GET/OP"><b>Options</b></a></p>
<p>The Options are accessible from the Main Menu screen, or by clicking the Menu button while playing the game. They are: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Music Volume, Fever Volume and Sound Effects:</b>
&quot;Music Volume&quot; sets the volume of in-game music, &quot;Fever Volume&quot; sets the volume of the &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; music that plays during Fever, and &quot;Sound Effects&quot; sets the volume of all non-music sounds. These sliders can be adjusted separately to fit your preference.
<li><b>Fullscreen</b><b>:</b> If this is checked, Peggle Nights will use your entire computer screen. If it is not checked, Peggle Nights will be played in a window.
<li><b>Custom Cursors:</b> If this box is checked, you will see special custom Peggle Nights cursors in the game rather than Windows standard cursors. If you have a special theme installed that changes your Windows cursors, you may need to activate this option to see the cursor properly in the game.
<li><b>3D Acceleration:</b> This box can be checked to improve performance for computers with supported video cards.

<p class="header">
<a name="PG"><b>PLAYING THE GAME</b> </a><a href="#top">[back to top]</a>
</p>
<p><a name="PG/GO"><b>Goal</b></a></p>
<p> Peggle Nights is a game where you try to hit 25 orange pegs with 10 metal balls. You are visiting the Peggle Institute and are invited to partake in the Peggle Masters' dreams and secret ambitions. Your goal is to complete the entire night's worth of dreams and usher in a new day.</p>

<p><a name="PG/BA"><b>The Basics</b></a></p>
<p>Peggle Nights is played on a Peggle board. The majority of the board is taken up by an array of pegs. At the top of the board is a Launcher, which you control. You aim the Launcher by moving the mouse cursor, and you fire it by clicking the left mouse button. Firing the Launcher shoots a Peggle ball that bounces around the board lighting up each peg it hits until falling off the bottom of the board. The lit pegs then disappear and you can take another shot.</p>
<p>You begin each level with ten balls. Light up the 25 orange pegs scattered randomly around the board to complete the level and achieve Extreme Fever.</p>

<p><a name="PG/CO"><b>Controls</b></a></p>
<p>The controls for Peggle Nights are simple: move your mouse cursor to the point where you want the ball to go. The Launcher will automatically aim to follow your mouse cursor.</p>
<p>Click the left mouse button to fire a Peggle ball. The ball will head to where the tip of the cursor was when you clicked.</p>
<p>You can hold down the right mouse button any time the ball is not in play to speed up the motion of the Free Ball Bucket and any moving pegs. This is helpful when waiting for moving objects.</p>
<p>You can also use the mouse wheel or the left and right arrow keys to make small angle adjustments. This is useful for getting the exact shot that you want. Hitting the Enter key will fire the ball. </p>

<p><a name="PG/PE"><b>Pegs</b></a></p>
<p>Pegs can be round or rectangular. If rectangular, they are sometimes called bricks.</p>
<p>Pegs come in four colors:
<ul>
<li><b>Blue (Standard peg):</b> These make up the vast majority of the pegs on the board.<br>Base value: 10 points.
<li><b>Orange (Goal peg):</b> There are 25 orange pegs per level, and they must all be lit in order to complete the level.<br>Base value: 100 points (10x blue).
<li><b>Purple (Point peg):</b> The purple peg is worth 50x the value of the blue pegs. There is one purple peg per turn and its location changes every shot. Purple pegs appear for the first time on the fourth level.<br>Base value: 500 points (50x blue).
<li><b>Green (Magic peg):</b> Hitting a green peg activates a Peggle Magic Power, either immediately or on the next shot (see <a href="#PG/PM">Peggle Masters and Magic Powers</a>, below). There are two green pegs per level. Green pegs appear for the first time on the third level. <br>Base value: 10 points (1x blue).
</ul>
</p>

<p><a name="PG/BT"><b>Ball-o-Tron</b></a></p>
<p>On the left side of the Peggle board is the Ball-o-Tron. The number at the top of the Ball-o-Tron shows how many balls you have left, and the balls themselves sit in the hopper underneath. You begin each level with 10 balls: 9 in the Ball-o-Tron and one pre-loaded in the Launcher at the top of the screen.</p>

<p><a name="PG/FM"><b>Fevermeter</b></a></p>
<p>On the right side of the Peggle board is the Fevermeter. As you eliminate orange pegs, the Fevermeter lights up. As you hit certain points on the Fevermeter, a score multiplier takes effect that increases the point value of your pegs. For a more detailed description of the score multiplier, see <a href="#SC/SH">Shot Scores</a> in the <a href="#SC">Scoring</a> section below.</p>

<p><a name="PG/FR"><b>Free Balls</b></a></p>
<p>Though you begin each level with 10 balls, there are several ways to earn Free Balls during play.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Free Ball Bucket:</b> The Free Ball Bucket moves back and forth across the bottom of the screen. If your ball lands in the Bucket it will be returned to the Ball-o-Tron for another shot.<br>You can speed up the Free Ball Bucket's motion while the ball is not in play by holding down the right mouse button, but once you've taken your shot you cannot directly control the Free Ball Bucket. You can, however, time your shot so that it has a greater chance of hitting the Free Ball Bucket. This is a key skill.<br>It is also possible to time your shot so that it hits the side of the Free Ball Bucket and bounces back into play. This is an essential skill for hitting hard to reach pegs.
<li><b>25k Shot Score:</b> As the ball bounces down the board it earns points for the shot (see <a href="#SC/SH">Scoring</a>, below). As the shot score rises the glass tubes on the sides of the Ball-o-Tron begin to fill up with green light. The green light reaches the top once the shot score reaches 25,000 points, and you are awarded a Free Ball.
<li><b>75k Shot Score:</b> If a shot score reaches 25,000 points and continues to climb, the Ball-o-Tron tubes will begin to fill with purple light. If the shot score reaches 75,000 points, you will be awarded a second Free Ball.
<li><b>125k Shot Score:</b> If a shot score reaches 75,000 points and continues to climb (it's possible!), the Ball-o-Tron tubes will begin to fill with yellow light. If the shot score reaches 125,000 points, you will be awarded a third Free Ball.
<li><b>Coin Flip:</b> If you don't hit any pegs on a shot, the Free Ball coin spins and you may be awarded a Free Ball.
</ul>
</p>

<p><a name="PG/EF"><b>Extreme Fever</b></a></p>
<p>Hitting the last orange peg on a level completes the level and activates Extreme Fever. The screen zooms in on the ball, time slows down, and the words &quot;Extreme Fever&quot; zestfully appear. You can click the left mouse button to end slow-motion mode and return to normal speed. </p>
<p>Blue and green pegs struck after Fever has been activated earn 1000 points each. Hitting a purple peg after Fever earns 10,000 points. </p>
<p>After activating Fever, the ball will continue on its way until falling into one of five bonus point areas that appear on the bottom of the board; from left to right their values are 10,000, 50,000, 100,000, 50,000 and 10,000 points. </p>

<p><a name="PG/UEF"><b>Ultra Extreme Fever</b></a>
<p>If you clear all the pegs on a level you will activate Ultra Extreme Fever. In that case all the five bonus point areas will award 100,000 points, and you will win a special All Pegs Cleared ribbon for that level. Rumor has it that a secret rank of Peggle Mastery awaits one who can get All Pegs Cleared ribbons for every Peggle board.</p>

<p><a name="PG/PM"><b>Peggle Masters and Magic Powers</b></a></p>
<p>The Masters watch your play from above the Launcher, and each of them has a special Magic Power that is activated when you hit the green peg. Some Magic Powers activate immediately, while others take effect on your next shot. The number above the Peggle Master's head shows how many shots remain on the Magic Power.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Super Guide</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Master:</b> Bjorn Unicorn
<li><b>Effect:</b> The Super Guide greatly extends the aiming line to show the path the ball will take through one bounce. Note that the ball does not travel in a straight line; instead, its path is curved as a result of the effect of gravity on the ball's motion. Use the Super Guide to get a sense of exactly how you should place your mouse cursor to get a specific shot. Though not as flashy as some of the later Magic Powers, mastering the Super Guide is the foundation of all Peggle skills.
<li><b>Activation:</b> Takes effect on next shot.
<li><b>Duration:</b> Three shots.
</ul></p>

<p><b>Multiball</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Master:</b> Jimmy Lightning
<li><b>Effect:</b> The Multiball Magic Power spawns a second ball from the green peg. If the green peg is hit on the right side then the Multiball will pop out on the left side, and vice versa. Both balls continue to bounce around the board and both contribute to the shot score. Skillful (or lucky) use of the Multiball can add up to big points as well as two chances to land a ball in the Free Ball Bucket. 
<li><b>Activation:</b> Takes effect immediately.
<li><b>Duration:</b> Lasts the length of the shot.
</ul></p>

<p><b>Spooky Ball</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Master:</b> Renfield Pumpkin
<li><b>Effect:</b> When the Spooky Ball is activated the ball will drop out of the bottom of the board and reappear at the top for a second pass through the Peggle board. The Spooky Ball reappears at the same spot at the top as it left the bottom. Any pegs hit on the ball's second pass are added to the shot score. Used skillfully, the Spooky Ball can be one of the most effective point-earning Magic Powers in the game. 
<li><b>Activation:</b> Takes effect immediately. Upon activation the Free Ball Bucket is capped; the cap is removed once the Spooky Ball does its disappearing-reappearing act.
<li><b>Duration:</b> Lasts the length of the shot.
</ul></p>

<p><b>Pyramid Power</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Master:</b> Kat Tut
<li><b>Effect:</b> The Pyramid Power adds pyramid-like bumpers to the sides of the Free Ball Bucket. This dramatically increases the chance that a ball will bounce back up into play or fall into the bucket.
<li><b>Activation:</b> Take effect immediately.
<li><b>Duration:</b> Five shots, including the activating shot.
</ul></p>

<p><b>Space Blast</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Master:</b> Splork
<li><b>Effect:</b> The Space Blast creates an explosion that lights up all pegs within slightly more than a four peg-width radius from the green peg. This is useful for clearing whole areas of the board, and you can boost your shot score by waiting until you can catch the purple peg in a Space Blast.
<li><b>Activation:</b> Takes effect immediately.
<li><b>Duration:</b> Instant.
</ul></p>

<p><b>Flippers</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Master:</b> Claude Lobster
<li><b>Effect:</b> Hitting the green peg causes two claw-like Flippers to appear at the lower left and right corners of the board. Flippers are used to pop the ball back up into play. Flip the Flippers by clicking the left mouse button. You can hold the Flippers in the flipped-up position by holding down the left mouse button; this is useful for trapping the ball with the Flippers to set up a good flip.
<li><b>Activation:</b> Takes effect immediately.
<li><b>Duration:</b> Three shots, including the activating shot.
</ul></p>

<p><b>Flower Power</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Master:</b> Tula Sunflower
<li><b>Effect:</b> The Flower Power will light up the closest one fifth (rounded up) of the remaining orange pegs (and never fewer than two) whenever the green peg is hit. This is effective at clearing large numbers of orange pegs at once and helps to push up the point multiplier on the Fevermeter. Use the Flower Power early to maximize its effect, or hold off until the end of the level to light up particularly hard-to-reach orange pegs.
<li><b>Activation:</b> Takes effect immediately.
<li><b>Duration:</b> Instant.
</ul></p>

<p><b>Fireball</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Master:</b> Lord Cinderbottom
<li><b>Effect:</b> When the Fireball is activated, the Peggle ball is replaced by a large burning sphere. The Fireball does not bounce when it hits a peg; instead it burns a path through the board, lighting up and instantly eliminating any pegs it touches. The Free Ball Bucket is capped while the Fireball is active, allowing you to bounce the Fireball off it to hit more pegs. The Free Ball Bucket cap disappears if the Fireball hits it.
<li><b>Activation:</b> Takes effect on the next shot.
<li><b>Duration:</b> Lasts for one shot.
</ul></p>

<p><b>Lucky Spin</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Master:</b> Warren Rabbit
<li><b>Effect:</b> Hitting the green peg drops down the Lucky Spin wheel and gives it a spin. The wheel has three outcomes: Triple Score, Magic Hat and a randomly chosen Magic Power.<br>
If the spinner lands on Triple Score, then the shot score will be tripled at the end of the shot, and the next shot will also have its shot score tripled.<br>
If the spinner lands on the Magic Hat, then the ball instantly acquires a top hat that bounces with the ball and lights up any pegs that it touches.<br>
If the spinner lands on the random Magic Power, then that power takes effect as it would normally, either instantly or on the next shot. <br>
If you click on the Lucky Spin wheel while the spin is in motion, the spinner will instantly arrive at the spot it was going to reach; this will not necessarily be the spot on the wheel where you clicked.
<li><b>Activation:</b> Takes effect immediately.
<li><b>Duration:</b> Variable. The Triple Score lasts for two shots, including the activating shot. The Magic Hat lasts for two shots, including the activating shot. The randomly chosen Magic Power lasts for as long as it normally would.
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Zen Ball</b> 
<ul>
<li><b>Master:</b> Master Hu 
<li><b>Effect:</b> When the Zen Ball is activated, Master Hu will consider a range of possible paths the ball could take on that shot and will nudge the ball to select the highest-scoring path, with additional weighting on dropping the ball in the Free Ball Bucket and lighting up orange pegs. Once you take the shot, Zen Ball will tell you how much it has improved your shot. &quot;No improvement&quot; means Zen Ball has not improved your shot. &quot;Zen achieved&quot; means your shot has been improved (by dropping the ball in the Free Ball Bucket, for instance) but not for additional points. &quot;(Some Percentage) More Zen&quot; means that your shot has been improved by the given percentage. &quot;Maximum Zen&quot; means your shot has been improved by more than 500% over the original shot.
<li><b>Activation:</b> Takes effect on the next shot.
<li><b>Duration:</b> Lasts one shot.
</ul></p>

<p><b>Electrobolt</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Master:</b> Marina
<li><b>Effect:</b> When the Electrobolt is activated, the ball crackles with energy and a grounding rod appears above the Free Ball Bucket. When the shot is taken, a bolt of lightning zaps from the first peg hit down to the grounding rod, lighting up pegs in between. Before the shot is taken, a moving shine of light on the pegs shows the rough path of the Electrobolt.
<li><b>Activation:</b> Takes effect on the next shot.
<li><b>Duration:</b> Lasts one shot.
</ul>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="PG/SS"><b>Style Shots</b></a></p>
<p>Certain kinds of cool shots will earn special recognition and bonus points. These bonus points add to your overall level score but do not add directly to your shot score (and thus do not help in earning a Free Ball).

<li><b>Super Long Shot:</b> Hit a non-blue peg, travel approximately 2/3 the width of the screen, hit another non-blue peg next or almost-next.<br>Points: 50,000 (10,000 in Duel Mode)

</p>

<p><a name="GM/AM"><b>Adventure Mode</b></a></p>
<p>Adventure Mode is the primary mode, and it allows you to train with all the Peggle Masters. Progress through all the levels to become a Peggle Master yourself. Adventure Mode is divided into 12 stages made up of five levels (or boards) each.

<p>Once you have completed Adventure Mode you may replay it at any time, and you will be allowed to use any Peggle Master on any level. Try to beat your high score!</p>

<p><a name="GM/QM"><b>Quick Play Mode</b></a></p>
<p>Quick Play Mode lets you select individual levels to play. You can also hit the Random button in the lower right corner of the screen to have an individual level selected for you. You may only play levels that you have completed in Adventure Mode, and you may only use Peggle Masters that you have unlocked in Adventure Mode. However, unlike in Adventure Mode, you are free to use any Peggle Master that you have unlocked and not just the one associated with a particular level.
</p>

<p><a name="GM/DM"><b>Duel Mode</b></a></p>
<p>Duel Mode is unlocked once you have completed Stage 1 of Adventure Mode. Duel Mode allows you to compete in a two-player version of Peggle Nights on any board you have completed in Adventure Mode. You can play against the computer or another person. The computer opponent has four difficulty settings: Easy (good for beginners); Normal (a well-rounded Duel Mode experience); Hard (for some extra challenge); and Master (the ultimate test for ultimate Peggle Masters).
</p>

<p>Duel Mode has slightly different rules than the single player modes. In Duel Mode, two players take turns shooting the ball. You must hit at least one orange peg on a shot; if you don't then you are penalized by losing 25% of your level score.</p>

<p>Each player starts the game with 6 balls. Generally, there are no Free Balls in Duel Mode. If you get a ball in the Free Ball Bucket you will not receive a Free Ball; instead, you will receive a point award in the form of a Bucket Bonus style shot. Each time a player gets this style shot, the point value of this shot will increase for the next player to get it. Scoring 25,000, 75,000 or 125,000 points on a shot, while awesome, will also not award you a Free Ball in Duel Mode, but will award a modest point bonus to recognize achieving one of the three point thresholds. Furthermore, players are also not awarded a coin flip Free Ball in Duel Mode.</p>

<p>The two green pegs appear one at a time rather than both together. When one is hit, the other will appear randomly on the board on the next shot.</p>

<p>The game ends either when a player eliminates the last orange peg or when both players run out of balls. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.</p>

<p><a name="GM/CM"><b>Challenge Mode</b></a></p>
<p>The first page of Challenge Mode is unlocked once you have completed the third stage of Adventure Mode (Renfield's "Nowhere Stairs"); the rest are unlocked once you complete Adventure mode. Challenge Mode presents you with extra difficult Peggle feats. There are 60 challenges, broken into 12 stages of 5 challenges each. They are:</p>

<p class="header">
<a name="SC"><b>SCORING</b> </a><a href="#top">[back to top]</a>
</p>
<p><a name="SC/SH"><b>Shot Score</b></a></p>
<p>The base value for a blue peg is 10 points.<br>
The base value for an orange peg is 100 points.<br>
The base value for a purple peg is 500 points.<br>
The base value for a green peg is 10 points.</p>

<p>Every peg you hit on a shot adds to a subtotal score. The shot score is the subtotal score multiplied by the number of pegs hit. It doesn't matter in which order the pegs are hit.</p>

<p>Example 1: On your first shot you hit blue (10), orange (100), blue (10), blue (10), orange (100), orange (100), green (10), purple (500) and blue (10). Your subtotal score would be 850 points (10 + 100 + 10 + 10 + 100 + 100 + 10 + 500 + 10). You hit 9 pegs, so your shot score would be 7,650 points (850 points x 9 pegs).</a>

<p>The value of all pegs goes up as orange pegs are eliminated. The Fevermeter on the right side of the board shows the current score multiplier.</p>

<blockquote>
<table width="100%"  border="0">
<tr>
<td><u>Orange Pegs Hit</u></td>
<td><u>Orange Pegs Remaining</u></td>
<td><u>Multiplier</u></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>25</td>
<td>1x</td>

<td>15</td>

<td>16</td>

<tr>

<td>3</td>
<td>10x</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>Example 2: You've already hit 13 orange pegs and there are 12 remaining. You shoot and hit blue, blue, orange, orange, orange, purple, orange, blue, blue and orange. The second orange peg you hit would bump the multiplier up from 2x to 3x, so the subtotal score would be 20 (blue @ 2x) + 20 (blue @ 2x) + 200 (orange @ 2x) + 300 (orange @ 3x) + 300 (orange @ 3x) + 1500 (purple @ 3x)+ 300 (orange @ 3x) + 30 (blue @ 3x) + 30 (blue @ 3x) + 300 (orange @ 3x) for a subtotal of 3,000 points. You hit ten pegs, so your final shot score would be 30,000 points (3,000 points x 10 pegs).</p> 

<p><a name="SC/FS"><b>Fever Score</b></a> (Points earned on last shot)<br>
Final shot points + Bonus Hole points + Extra Ball Bonus</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Shot points:</b> Hitting the final orange peg sets off Extreme Fever. Scoring for the last shot taken is calculated the same way as other shot points (subtotaled value of pegs hit x number of pegs hit). Blue or green pegs hit after Fever are worth 1,000 points each; the purple peg is worth 10,000 points.

<li><b>Bonus Holes:</b> At the end of Fever, the ball drops into one of five Bonus Holes on the bottom of the screen. The Bonus Holes are worth, from left to right, 10k, 50k, 100k, 50k and 10k points.<br>If you achieve <b>Ultra Extreme Fever</b> by clearing all pegs, the bonus holes will all award 100,000 points.

<li><b>Extra Balls:</b> You receive 10,000 points per extra ball left over.

</ul>
<p>Note: Magic Powers can be active or activated during Fever (e.g. if Multiball is active, both balls will score points for landing in Bonus Holes).</p>

<p><a name="SC/SP"><b>Style Points</b></a>
<p>As previously mentioned in the <a href="#PG/SS">Style Shots</a> section above, certain cool shots earn additional points. These points do not contribute to earning Free Balls, but they do add to your level score. Style shots score differently in Duel Mode than in the other modes, and some style shots cannot be done in Duel Mode.</p>

<p>The peg values in Duel Mode are the same as in Adventure Mode, as is the point multiplier and the method of calculating shot scores (subtotaled value of pegs x number of pegs hit).</p>
<p>Unlike in Adventure or Quick Play, the Bonus Holes in Duel are worth, from left to right, 5,000, 25,000, 50,000, 25,000 and 5,000 points. There is no Ultra Extreme Fever in Duel Mode, and the bonus for extra balls left over is 5,000 points instead of 10,000.</p>

<p><a name="SC/AS"><b>Ace Scores</b></a></p>
<p>Each board has an associated Ace Score. Beating this score in Adventure or Quick Play modes earns an Ace Score ribbon on that board in the Quick Play menu. Achieving Ace Scores in all the boards earns an Ace Score Trophy.</p>

<p><a name="SC/ST"><b>Stats and Trophies</b></a></p>
<p>Clicking the Stats button on the Main Menu accesses a Stats screen.</p>
<p>The High Scores section lists 10 all-time high scores in Adventure mode over all profiles, with preset scores to beat.</p>
<p>The Your Best Scores section lists the 10 best Adventure scores for the current profile.</p>
<p>The Your All-Time Stats section lists the number of shots, Free Balls and Style Shots for the current profile, the Best Shot and Best Fever scores for the current profile, the number of Challenges finished for the current profile, the number of levels 100% cleared for the current profile and the number of Ace Scores achieved for the current profile.</p>
<p>The Current Adventure Stats section lists the number of shots, Free Balls and Style Shots for the current Adventure of the current profile; the Best Shot, Best Fever and total scores for the current Adventure of the current profile; the number of retried levels for the current Adventure of the current profile and the number of Loading Screen fairies clicked for the current profile.</p>
<p>Clicking the Trophies button on the Stats Screen takes you to the Trophy room, which displays portraits of unlocked Peggle Masters and all collected Trophies for the current profile. There are four Trophies to be won, and they are awarded for: completing Adventure, achieving Ace Scores on all levels, achieving All Clears on all levels, and completing all of the Challenges.</p>

<a name="GT"><b>GAMEPLAY TIPS</b> </a><a href="#top">[back to top]</a>
</p>

<p><a name="GT/BT"><b>Basic Tips</b></a><br>
The ball will head to the exact position of the tip of your mouse cursor when you fire.<br>
Use the mouse wheel or arrow keys to aim more precisely.<br>
Hold down the right mouse button to speed up time.  This is helpful when waiting for a specific shot.<br>
Peg values go up as the number of orange pegs decreases.  The Fevermeter on the right indicates the current point multiplier.<br>
When pegs are worth 10x, you can score over 25,000 points by hitting the purple peg and at least four other pegs.<br>
Clear all of the pegs on a level to get Ultra Extreme Fever!</p>

<p><a name="GT/GT"><b>General Tips</b></a><br>
Aiming for a higher orange peg is usually a good strategy since you might hit the lower ones later on in the shot.<br>
Sometimes you can get a hard-to-reach peg by bouncing off the wall.<br>
You can try to get a Free Ball on every turn by estimating where the ball will land and timing your shot with the Free Ball Bucket accordingly.  You won't get it every time, but it can't hurt!<br>
Clear blue pegs out of the way to get to orange pegs. If you have enough balls left, it's easier to spend a shot clearing a blue peg rather than trying a crazy bank shot.<br>
The purple peg is great for a point boost, but don't get too distracted by it. Points are good, but not as good as clearing the level.<br>
If you have extra balls left near the end of a level, try some crazy shots to improve your Peggle skills!<br>
If you're having trouble with the Challenge levels, try using different Peggle Masters. Some Magic Powers are dramatically more effective for certain challenges than others.<br>
For advanced players, try to keep as many blue pegs on screen as you can until youve got only a couple of orange pegs left; then combo a purple peg with as many blue pegs as you can for BIG point bonuses.<br>
Practice with Bjorn, practice with Bjorn, practice with Bjorn.</p>

<p><a name="GT/MST"><b>Master-Specific Tips</b></a></p>
<p><blockquote>
<b>Bjorn (Super Guide)</b><br>
Use the mouse wheel or arrow keys to more precisely aim the Super Guide.<br>
Use Bjorn's Super Guide to build familiarity with how the ball bounces and the path it takes. Ideally you should be able to imagine the Super Guide without it even being there.<br>
Use the Super Guide to pick out and practice useful shots like the Long Shot, the Super Long Shot and the Free Ball Skills shot.<br>
Use the Super Guide to hit the purple peg after getting Fever.<br>
Use the Super Guide to aim for the 100,000 point hole during Fever.<br>
The Super Guide tends to be more useful later in the level when the board's not so crowded.<br><br>

<b>Jimmy Lightning (Multiball)</b><br>
With careful timing you can drop both Multiballs in the Free Ball bucket for a Free Ball Frenzy.<br>
Get the Multiball and the purple peg on the same turn for massive point possibilities.<br><br>

<b>Renfield (Spooky Ball)</b><br>
Spooky Ball's twice-around ability allows for extremely high-scoring shots.<br>
For monstrous points tag lots of pegs with the Spooky Ball before it wraps around.<br>
Try to get the Spooky Ball to exit at an angle so it re-enters the top going a different way.  This way, it'll go someplace different instead of just falling through all of the pegs that you just cleared.
<br><br>

<b>Kat Tut (Pyramid Power)</b><br>
The Pyramid Power is great for extra Free Balls or as a platform for tricky bank shots.<br><br>

<b>Splork (Space Blast)</b><br>
Tag the purple point peg with the Space Blast for extra points.<br>
Try leaving a cluster of pegs near the green peg alone, then hit it with the Space Blast when your multiplier is up.<br>

<b>Claude (Flippers)</b><br>
Use the Flippers to bounce shots back against the wall for tricky angles.
<br><br>

<b>Tula (Flower Power)</b><br>
Use the Flower Power early in a level to push up the Fevermeter and increase the point multiplier.<br><br>

<b>Lord Cinderbottom (Fireball)</b><br>
Bounce the Fireball off the Free Ball Bucket for extra burnination and points.<br><br>

<b>Warren (Lucky Spin)</b><br>
The Triple Score makes Lucky Spin one of the most effective point-scoring Magic Powers.<br>
Try to hold off at least one Lucky Spin until late in the level; that way the Triple Score (if you get it) will be tripling an already point-multiplied shot score.<br>
If you get the Magic Hat, try shooting it into clumps of pegs or under arcs for maximum peg light-up.<br><br>

<b>Master Hu (Zen Ball)</b><br>
The Zen Ball works best when it has lots of alternate angles to consider. Aim at a peg or the corner of a brick for maximum Zen magic.<br>
Shoot the Zen Ball at pegs high up on the screen to get as many other pegs on the way down as possible.<br><br>

<b>Marina (Electrobolt)</b><br>
Shoot high to maximize the Electrobolt's effectiveness.<br>
Try to tag the purple point peg with Marina's Electrobolt for extra points.<br>
The glowlight on the pegs shows which peg will be first hit. Use this to your advantage to calculate shots off of walls and bumpers.<br>
Try leaving an area with a lot of pegs for later, then hit it with an Electrobolt once your mulitplier is up.<br>
