<a name="PG"><b>PLAYING THE GAME</b> <a href="#top">[back to top]</a></a>
</p>

<p><a name="PG/G"><b>Goal</b></a></p>
<p>The goal of Bookworm is to make words to feed the hungry Bookworm, while watching out for burning letters that could ignite your library!</p>
<p>There are two game types: Classic and Action. But the basics remain the same for both... click on tiles to link them together into words, then hit Submit to clear them from the board.</p>

<p><a name="PG/GB"><b>Gameplay Basics</b></a></p>
<p>In both game types, the basic interface is the same. You must create words by linking letters on the board together. To select a letter, just click on it. Then select another letter adjacent to the first, and then another one adjacent to that, until you have formed a word of at least 3 letters. When you have a valid word, click the Submit button and it will be removed from the screen.</p>
<p>You can tell if your word is valid by looking at the sidebar... if there is a point value under your word, the game accepts it as a real word.</p>
<p>Letters must be adjacent, and you can't backtrack... small green arrows will show you the 'path' of the word you're creating.</p>
<p><a name="PG/IT"><b>Interface Tips</b></a></p>
<p>You can also Submit a word by double-clicking quickly on the last letter.</p>
<p>If you change your mind and want to deselect a letter in a word, just click on it a second time. Or, you can just click on a letter not adjacent to your word and the focus will switch to that one.</p>
<p>Right clicking will also deselect any letters you have selected.</p>
<p>You can also create a word by clicking and dragging a path... click on the first letter and hold the mouse down, then move the cursor over the letters in the word you want to make. When you're over the final letter, release the mouse button. If it's valid word, it will automatically be submitted!</p>
<p><a name="PG/BT"><b>Burning Tiles</b></a></p>
<p>You'll see red tiles appear occasionally. Be careful! If you let them hit the bottom of the screen, your game will end! You can get rid of burning tiles by using them in words like any other letter.</p>
<p><a name="PG/RT"><b>Reward Tiles</b></a></p>
<p>Green tiles appear randomly and increase word scores! Earn gold tiles by creating words containing 5 letters or more. Gold tiles are worth more than green ones! Combine 2 or more reward tiles in a word for higher word scores! Plus, you can earn Diamond and Sapphire tiles!</p>
<p><a name="PG/BW"><b>Bonus Words</b></a></p>
<p>Starting on the second level, you'll see a Bonus Word appear beneath the Bookworm. If you complete this word you'll score extra points! The more Bonus Words you complete in a single game, the bigger the bonuses!</p>
<p><a name="PG/GT"><b>Game Types</b></a></p>
<p>After the game loads, you will see a screen allowing you to choose Classic or Action games. New players should start with Classic mode, while experienced Bookworm players may prefer the more frenetic Action mode.</p>
<p><a name="PG/CG"><b>Classic Game</b></a></p>
<p>This is the original game of Bookworm. You have as much time as you want to make each move, so you can carefully consider every letter if you like.</p>
<p>In the Classic game, burning red tiles will appear after a certain number of moves. As you go up in levels, red tiles will appear more frequently. Red tiles will burn through normal tiles with every passing turn. If they reach the bottom of the stack, they will ignite the library, ending your game.</p>
<p><a name="PG/AG"><b>Action Game</b></a></p>
<p>The Action game is a more fast-paced real-time version of Bookworm. In this mode, burning red tiles appear automatically every few seconds, whether you move or not! And they will burn down through your library the same way, so you have to think fast!</p>

<p><a name="PG/O"><b>Options</b></a></p>
<p>The Options are accessible from the first game selection screen, or by clicking the Menu button while playing the game. They include:
<ul>
<li><b>Music Volume and Sound Effects:</b> The two sliders at the top of the Options dialog control the volume of the sound effects and music. You can adjust them separately. If you want to turn the music or sound off completely, just drag the slider all the way to the left.
<li><b>Fullscreen:</b> The Full Screen option is enabled by checking the box next to it. This will cause Bookworm to take up the whole screen. Some players may prefer this, while others may like it better in a window, where they can easily switch to other applications. To change back to windowed mode, just uncheck the Fullscreen box.
<li><b>Custom Cursors:</b> This option will enable custom cursors within Bookworm, instead of using your default Windows cursors. If you have an unusual Windows theme, or are otherwise seeing strange mouse cursor behavior, you may want to enable this option.
<li><b>Show Hints:</b> When the Show Hints checkbox is checked, hints will appear during play giving you instructions on how to play the game. You can disable these during gameplay, or by unchecking this box in Options.
<li><b>Show Definitions:</b> When Definitions are on, Lex the Bookworm will give you the definitions for selected words when you create them... usually exotic or unusual ones. If you don't like this feature, you can turn it off in the Options menu.
<li><b>Hardware Acceleration</b> Checking this box will enable hardware acceleration in order to improve game performance. Hardware acceleration will not work with older video cards.
<li><b>Help:</b> This will show you instructions on how to play Bookworm Deluxe.
<li><b>Credits:</b> Click this to see the fine folks who brought you Bookworm!

<a name="SC"><b>SCORING</b> <a href="#top">[back to top]</a></a>
</p>

<p>You score points based on the length of your word and the rarity of the letters in it.</p>
<p>Letters on plain tiles are the most common, and worth the least points.</p>
<p>Tiles with a dot in the corner are rarer letters, worth more points.</p>
<p>Two dots in the corner indicates a letter that is even rarer and consequently more valuable.</p>
<p>And three dots indicate the most difficult and valuable letters.</p>
<p>The value of a word is based on its length, the rarity of the letters used, and the current level of the game. Bonus tiles, such as the green, sapphire, and diamond tiles, will multiply the value by 2, 3, 4 or more for each such tile in the word. Create words with 2 or more bonus tiles to achieve truly stratospheric scores!</p>
<p>You also receive points for completing the Bonus Word on levels 2 and beyond. The value of the Bonus Word increases each time you successfully complete one.</p>

<p class=header>
<a name="HF"><b>HALL OF FAME</b> <a href="#top">[back to top]</a></a>
</p>

<p>You can visit the Hall of Fame from either the main game selector screen, or after a game. This lets you submit and see the high scores and best words players have made in the game!</p>
