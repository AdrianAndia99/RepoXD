<p>Troubleshooting</p>
<p>---------------</p>
<p>This software has been tested to operate on the above system requirements. If you experience any problems such as system crashes, any graphics issues or error messages, please
try one of the following:</p>
<p>1) Update your computer's video or sound card drivers. This can be done by identifying the type of sound card and video card your computer is using and finding the manufacturer's web site where new drivers may be made available for download.</p>
<p>2) Upgrade DirectX. This is a Microsoft component and can improve the graphics, security, and performance of your Windows operating system.</p>
<p>3) If 1 and 2 do not fix graphic problems please go to &quot;Options&quot; menu available on the main menu and UNCHECK &quot;Use 3D Hardware Acceleration&quot;.</p>
<p>4) If you are still experiencing graphical display problems (such as mixed up images or your mouse cursor flickering), you can try forcing the game to start without 3-D
hardware acceleration by holding down the &quot;Shift&quot; key when you start the game.</p>
