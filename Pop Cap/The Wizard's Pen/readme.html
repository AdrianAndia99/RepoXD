<p>When you first launch The Wizard’s Pen, you will be asked to enter your name on the &quot;Who Goes There&quot; popup box. Your progress and high scores will be saved when you quit. If there are several people playing on one computer, you will want to create separate profiles for each. To do this, click on the link located at the bottom-left of your screen that reads, &quot;Not you? Click here.&quot; A dialog box will appear allowing you to select another identity, or create a new one.</p>
<p><a name="GET/SE"><b>Game Selection</b></a></p>
<p>The Wizard’s Pen has two variations of play: a sequential story mode (Story), and a series of smaller sketchbooks. At the beginning of the game only Story Mode is available; sketchbooks are unlocked as you play the game.</p>

<a name="PG"><b>PLAYING THE GAME</b> </a><a href="#top">[back to top]</a>
</p>
<p><a name="PG/GO"><b>Goal</b></a></p>
<p>The Wizard has gone missing! It’s up to you and his trusted pen to discover what happened to him. He has left behind a book with mysterious pictures that need to be guessed by you. Strange objects, from past, present, and future are all contained within the pages of his book.</p>

<p><a name="PG/BA"><b>The Basics</b></a></p>
<p>Each page of the Wizard’s book contains an item that must be guessed. You must choose what areas of the page you want the pen to reveal. After you have figured out what the pictured item is, make your guess!</p>

<p><a name="PG/CO"><b>Controls</b></a></p>
<p>The controls for The Wizard’s Pen are simple: move your mouse cursor to the point where you want the pen to draw.</p>
<p>Click the left mouse button to bring the pen to life and draw where your cursor is located.</p>
<p>When you know what the item pictured is, simply type your answer in the box below the page and click the &quot;Submit&quot; button.</p>

<p><a name="PG/TC"><b>The Candle</b></a></p>
<p>To the left of the book is a candle. Each time the pen draws, the candle burns lower. If the candle burns all the way down to its base, you have one more chance to make your guess. To the left of the candle, there is a sign that tells you how many &quot;burns&quot; are remaining for the candle.</p>

<p><a name="PG/S"><b>Stars</b></a></p>
<p>After you guess the item in the book, you’re awarded magical stars that unlock sketchbooks to play later. The number of stars awarded depends on how many &quot;scribbles&quot; you used before guessing the picture.</p>

<ul>
<li>0-1 Scribbles: <b>10 Stars Awarded</b>
<li>&quot;Give Up&quot; Button Pressed: <b>0 Stars Awarded</b>
<li>Otherwise, you’re awarded the number of candle burns left, plus one
</ul>

<p><a name="PG/P"><b>Potions</b></a></p>
<p>To the right of your book, there is a shelf containing potions to help you identify the item on the book’s page. To activate a potion, click on it with your left mouse button, then watch it spring into action! At first, there won’t be any potions, but you earn them as you progress through the story.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Potion of Perception:</b> Quadruple your drawing area for one turn!
<li><b>Frozen Candle:</b> Freeze the candle for a few turns and adds one turn.
<li><b>Anagram Potion:</b> Get an anagram of the item you're guessing!
<li><b>Drippy Ink:</b> Watch the ink drip down the page next turn, revealing more!
<li><b>Hint Potion:</b> Use this potion to give you a hint!
<li><b>Crystal Ball:</b> See the next three objects, blended together!
<li><b>Clean Slate:</b> Wipes the paper clear, but restores your candle!
<li><b>Swirl Potion:</b> A magical swirl draws on the image, revealing its path!
<li><b>Silhouette:</b> Use this potion to see a silhouette of the image!
<li><b>Lightning:</b> Lightning strikes and reveals the image for a split second!
</ul>

<p><a name="PG/CH"><b>Challenges</b></a></p>
<p>Every few pages, the book presents a challenge for you to solve. These are different than the normal pages of the book, with each one drawing on a different discipline to solve.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Abstract Challenge:</b> The page starts out as an abstract painting, and each click makes the picture become clearer.
<li><b>Zoom Challenge:</b> The book’s page pictures an object from a very close perspective, but each click makes the picture zoom out a little more.
<li><b>Twist Challenge:</b> The image on the page is swirled beyond recognition, but each click makes the picture untwist.
<li><b>Mosaic Challenge:</b> You will see a very blocky picture in the book, but each click reduces the size of these blocks.
<li><b>Pointillism Challenge:</b> Like a Monet painting, the image is composed of tiny dots, with each click making the picture become more realistic
<li><b>Scramble Challenge:</b> The page is made up of scrambled tiles, but each click unscrambles the picture a little more.
<li><b>Memory Challenge:</b> This is just like regular pages, except when you click, your previous draw is erased!
</ul>

<p><a name="PG/CS"><b>Chapter Summary</b></a></p>
<p>After you have completed a 16-page chapter, the name of the chapter will be revealed to you. Then you will see a summary of how you did, while your collected stars empty and cause a pendulum to swing to the right. When it’s all the way to the right, you have collected 200 and a sketchbook unlocks. You can access the sketchbook from the main menu, any time you want.</p>

<p><a name="PG/MIMG"><b>Missing Items Mini-Games</b></a>
<p>After each chapter, there are scenes that aren’t quite complete, with items missing from them. You need to make sure the pen draws these items, by clicking your left mouse button where the item <b>should</b> be. If you need help, there’s a hint button at the top of the panel. It reveals the location of the top missing item on the list, but once you use it, you won’t be able to use it again for another 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Earn stars by finding all of the items. Using hints and spilling ink on the page, which is done by clicking randomly, will decrease the total number of stars you can earn.</p>

<p><a name="PG/TT"><b>The Tower</b></a></p>
<p>After you complete the missing items mini-game, you will see the entire tower rise towards the light. Why is it rising? We will leave that to you to find out.</p>

<p><a name="PG/PS"><b>Potion Shelf</b></a></p>
<p>After you see the tower rise, you will zoom back in the tower to the potion shelf. This is where you get to pick potions to use during game play. There won’t be many at first, but eventually, there will be a full batch of 10 different potions to choose from. You can pick three potions to take with you in the next chapter.</p>

<p><a name="PG/SB"><b>Sketchbooks</b></a></p>
<p>As you play, you will unlock sketchbooks. These were the work pages the Wizard didn’t use in his book. Each book is a little different and features one specific challenge.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Artistics Sketchbook:</b> Features the Abstract Challenge.
<li><b>Miniatures Sketchbook:</b> Features the Zoom Challenge.
<li><b>Swirls Sketchbook:</b> Features the Twist Challenge.
<li><b>Blockism Sketchbook:</b> Features the Mosaic Challenge.
<li><b>Spotness Sketchbook:</b> Features the Pointillism Challenge.
<li><b>Angulars Sketchbook:</b> Features the Scramble Challenge.
<li><b>Memories Sketchbook:</b> Features the Memory Challenge.

<a name="GT"><b>GAMEPLAY TIPS</b> </a><a href="#top">[back to top]</a>
</p>

<p><a name="GT/BT"><b>Basic Tips</b></a><br>

<ul>
<li>Take your time! Study the image after each scribble. Sometimes the smallest detail can be a clue!
<li>Use your potions. You get three new ones at the end of every chapter. So if you’re stuck, a potion can help.
<li>Usually, the middle of the page is the best place to start. So start drawing from the middle, and work your way to the edge of the page.
</ul>

<p><a name="GT/GT"><b>General Tips</b></a><br>

<ul>
<li>After the first few pages of a chapter, you might have a good idea what it’s about. Try to remember that for the upcoming pages, because it can provide clues to what the item might be.
<li>Don’t overdraw! There is a square of light underneath the cursor, make sure it doesn’t overlap with anywhere the pen has already drawn.
<li>For the Zoom Challenge, you can click on different portions of the picture, and it will move the image in addition to zooming. This can help zoom to the location of your choice.
<li>In the missing item pages, don’t randomly click. You gain more stars if you avoid ink spills and using hints.
<li>Learn which potions are best. Not all potions are created equal, so find the ones that help you solve pages the fastest, and choose those potions.
<li>Don’t be afraid to guess. A wrong guess only costs one star, but a guess after the first scribble will earn you ten!
