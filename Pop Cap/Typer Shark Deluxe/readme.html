<A name="I"><B>INSTRUCTIONS</B> <A href="#top">[back to top]</A></A>
</P>

<P><A name="I/I"><B>Introduction</B></A></P>
<P>Typer Shark Deluxe is a typing tutor unlike any you've ever seen before! Dive deep into the ocean depths with only your keyboard for protection... and zap menacing Word Sharks by typing the words printed on their sides. Discover sunken treasure, or test your skills to the max in the Abyss!</P>
<P>Typer Shark features three ways to play: you can choose your path by progressing through the Adventure mode, play a fast arcade game in the Abyss, or improve your typing skills with the Typing Tutor mode.</P>
<P><A name="I/CP"><B>Creating a Profile</B></A></P>
<P>If it's your first time playing, you'll be asked to create a profile with your name. This is used to identify you in case there are multiple people playing on the same machine: each can have separate saved games and statistics. If you need to create a new profile later, just click on the link that says, "Click here if this is not you." This will let you pick a different profile or create a new one.</P>
<P><A name="I/GS"><B>Game Selection</B></A></P>
<P>Once the game has finished loading, you will find yourself on the Game Selector screen. If it is the first time you've launched Typer Shark, you'll be prompted to take a typing test to determine your current typing speed. This will let the program recommend an appropriate skill level for you to play at.</P>
<P>From this screen, you can select one of the three game modes: Adventure, Abyss, and Tutorial, or access your Statistics. You can also change Game Options or Quit back to Windows.</P>
<P><A name="I/GM"><B>Game Modes</B></A></P>
<P>If you select Adventure mode, your recommended difficulty level will be highlighted if you've taken the typing test. This is the level you should probably start at to get a solid challenge.</P>
<P>Pick a difficulty level to start the game. See <A href="#AM">Adventure Mode</A> later for more details.</P>
<P>If you pick Abyss mode, you will start either at the surface, or at any of the 400-foot markers you placed while previously playing Abyss. This allows you to start at a deeper depth once you've proven your skills.</P>
<P>See <A href="#AB">Abyss Mode</A> later for more details.</P>
<P>If you pick the Typing Tutor, you will go to the Tutorial screen, where you can improve your skills with one of 18 typing lessons. You can also retake the typing test at any time to see your current words per minute.</P>
<P>See <A href="#TT">Typing Tutor Mode</A> later for more details.</P>
<P><A name="I/O"><B>Options</B></A></P>
<P>The Options are accessible by clicking the Options button while playing the game. They include:
<UL>
<LI><B>Music Volume and Sound Effects:</B> you can adjust these volume sliders separately to fit your preferences.</LI>
<LI><B>Fullscreen:</B> If this is checked, Typer Shark Deluxe will use your entire computer screen. If it is not checked, Typer Shark Deluxe will be played in a window. It’s up to you to decide which you prefer.</LI>
<LI><B>Enable Fx:</B> If this is checked, Typer Shark Deluxe will show additional graphical effects.  This may slow down the game on some computers.</LI>
<LI><B>Custom Cursors:</B> If this box is checked, you will see special custom Typer Shark Deluxe cursors in the game rather than Windows standard cursors. If you have a special theme installed that changes your Windows cursors, you may need to activate this option to see the cursor properly in the game.</LI>
<LI><B>Space Bar Pauses Game:</B> If you enable this option, pressing the Space Bar will pause any game. This is off by default.</LI>
<LI><B>Hardware Acceleration:</B> This box can be checked to improve performance for computers with supported video cards.</LI>
</UL></P>
<P><A name="I/HF"><B>Hall of Fame</B></A></P>
<P>You can check out the Hall of Fame to see the best scores in Adventure and Abyss mode.</P>
<P><A name="I/S"><B>Statistics</B></A></P>
<P>Click on this to see your own personal statistics in Adventure, Abyss, and Typing Tutor modes. See if you're improving over time!</P>

<P class=header>
<A name="AM"><B>ADVENTURE MODE</B> <A href="#top">[back to top]</A></A>
</P>

<P><A name="AM/O"><B>Overview</B></A></P>
<P>Adventure mode lets you choose your path as you salvage shipwrecks across the Seven Seas, and beyond, into the mysterious depths of the infinite sea!</P>
<P>There are many different enemies and bonuses in Adventure Mode, including special secret levels.</P>
<P><A name="AM/HP"><B>How To Play</B></A></P>
<P>Sharks and other enemies will swim towards you from the right side of the screen. Type the words printed on their sides to zap them! If they reach the far left side of the screen, they will chomp you and you'll lose one of your three lives.</P>
<P><A name="AM/SZ"><B>Shark Zapper</B></A></P>
<P>Your Shark Zapper charges up over time and as you zap enemies. When it is fully charged, you can use it to zap all enemies on screen at once! Press ENTER to fire your Shark Zapper once it is charged.</P>
<P><A name="AM/SB"><B>Shipwreck Bonus</B></A></P>
<P>When you reach the ocean floor, you'll find a shipwreck hiding sunken treasures. You have less than 30 seconds to recover as much as you can! Type as many of the words that appear as you can before time runs out.</P>
<P><A name="AM/MS"><B>Map Screen</B></A></P>
<P>Once you finish the shipwreck segment, you will go to a map screen depicting your progress. In some cases, you may be able to choose your next destination! Read the descriptions of each site carefully... some are more dangerous than others!</P>
<P><A name="AM/E"><B>Enemies</B></A></P>
<P>Keep an eye out as you advance, and you will see all sorts of different foes to battle... ghost sharks, tiger sharks, hammerheads, piranhas, and 4 different boss monsters!</P>
<P><A name="AM/EW"><B>Endless Waters</B></A></P>
<P>If you make it to the end of the Adventure game, you'll have the option of proceeding into the endless waters. Do you dare learn the secrets?</P>
<P><A name="AM/S"><B>Secrets</B></A></P>
<P>There are several special levels you can discover if you're clever! But we'll leave that for you to figure out...</P>
<P><A name="AM/SG"><B>Saved Games</B></A></P>
<P>Games are only saved at the beginning of a new level. So if you have completed a level and are on the map screen, make sure to select a new dive location before quitting out, otherwise you will have to replay the previous level when you restart the game later.</P>

<P class=header>
<A name="AB"><B>ABYSS MODE</B> <A href="#top">[back to top]</A></A>
</P>

<P><A name="AB/O"><B>Overview</B></A></P>
<P>If you don't have the time to play a full Adventure game, try the Abyss mode for a quick fix! Dive as deep as you can into increasingly deadly waters... how low can you go?</P>
<P><A name="AB/HP"><B>How To Play</B></A></P>
<P>Abyss mode works just like Adventure mode, except you don't get any breaks! It just keeps getting harder and harder until you perish... but how far down can you make it? What horrible beasts of the deep will you discover?</P>
<P>Type the words on the sides of the oncoming enemies to zap them. When your Shark Zapper is charged, press ENTER to zap all onscreen enemies at once.</P>
<P><A name="AB/DM"><B>Depth Markers</B></A></P>
<P>Every 400 feet, your progress in Abyss mode is saved. That means the next time you play, you can either start at the surface, or at any of the depth markers you previously set. The status of your Shark Zapper is also saved at each depth marker.</P>

<P class=header>
<A name="TT"><B>TYPING TUTOR MODE</B> <A href="#top">[back to top]</A></A>
</P>

<P><A name="TT/O"><B>Overview</B></A></P>

<P>The Typing Tutor will help you to learn touch-typing, if you don't know it, or improve your skills if you do! You might be surprised at what a little practice can do!</P>
<P><A name="TT/HP"><B>How To Play</B></A></P>
<P>On the sidebar, you will see a description of the current lesson, along with an Options button and arrows to take you to the previous and next lessons. You can skip ahead if you want to, but you won't get a "passing" grade on a lesson until you complete it. Some lessons have specific goals you must complete, such as finishing it in a certain amount of time or with a certain degree of accuracy, before they are considered passed.</P>
<P>When you are ready to begin, simply start typing the words as displayed at the top of the screen.</P>
<P><A name="TT/A"><B>Assistance</B></A></P>
<P>If you watch the keyboard and animated hands below, you will see them change to help you improve your typing. The hands will show you which finger you're supposed to use to strike each key... if you are using a different finger, you should try to change your habits to use the proper one.</P>
<P>Likewise, the keyboard will light up to show you the position of the next key you are supposed to strike.</P>

<P class=header>
<A name="SC"><B>SCORING</B> <A href="#top">[back to top]</A></A>
</P>

<P><A name="SC/GS"><B>General Scoring</B></A></P>
<P>In general, points are earned based on the difficulty of the word being typed, as well as the difficulty level selected. Other bonuses are awarded based on accuracy, quantity of enemies killed, and other factors.</P>
<P>Here are the values assigned to each character:</P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=2>ASDFGHJKLE</TD><TD>1 point</TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=2>RTYUIMNVB</TD><TD>2 points</TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=2>QZXCWPO1234567890</TD><TD>3 points</TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=2>Punctuation</TD><TD>4 points</TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=3>
<P>The value of the whole word is then multiplied by 15 in adventure mode, and at least 30 in abyss mode (the value increases the deeper you dive).</P>
<P><B>Bonus Jellyfish</B> are scored in the same way, but the points are multiplied by the total number of jellyfish killed in the wave. Also, each jellyfish killed charges the Shark Zapper by 1%.</P>
<P>An <B>Accuracy Bonus</B> is awarded if you achieve typing accuracy of 95% or better in a wave. This bonus is cumulative for consecutive waves, so if you achieve 95% or better accuracy again in the next wave, your bonus will be higher.</P>
<P>Additionally, if you earn 95% or better accuracy during an entire level, you will earn bonus points. These bonuses are also cumulative and get higher if you earn 95% or better accuracy bonuses on consecutive levels.</P>
<P>The words that appear in the <B>Treasure Ship</B> at the end of each level are scored differently. Each <B>Treasure Word</B> scores the following points:
<BR>1700 for X-treme
<BR>1000 for Expert
<BR>450 for Hard
<BR>150 for Normal
<BR>50 for Easy</P>
<P>The total point value awarded for the entire Treasure Ship Round is based on the number of words typed, as well as the difficulty level.</P>
<P><B>Boss Monsters</B> are worth the following values:</P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=2>X-treme</TD><TD>100,000</TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=2>Expert</TD><TD>70,000</TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=2>Hard</TD><TD>50,000</TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=2>Normal</TD><TD>30,000</TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=2>Easy</TD><TD>10,000</TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=3>
<P>In Abyss mode the Boss Monsters are worth 100,000 points each.</P>
<P><A name="SC/EL"><B>Extra Lives</B></A></P>
<P>Here are the points required to earn extra lives (applies to Adventure Mode only):</P>
<P><B>Easy:</B> first extra life at 625,000, after that every 400,000
<BR><B>Normal:</B> first at 775,000, next at 115,000, then every 600,000
<BR><B>Hard:</B> first at 900,000, then 1,550,000, then every 800,000
<BR><B>Expert:</B> first at 1,250,000 then 1,750,000 then every 1,500,000
<BR><B>X-treme:</B> first at 1,500,000 then 2,000,000 then every 2,000,000</P>
