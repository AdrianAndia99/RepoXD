<String id="TUTORIAL_FIRST_PIECE">The object of the game is to turn the whole board into GOLD by placing magic RUNES on every square. Now, place your first Rune next to the grey Stone below.</String>
<String id="TUTORIAL_FIRST_PIECE_DONE">Very good! Click the NEXT button below to continue with the tutorial.</String>
<String id="TUTORIAL_MORE_PIECES">Each Rune must be placed next to another that's already on the board. In addition, it must match that Rune in either COLOR or SHAPE... or both. Place a few more Runes now.</String>
<String id="TUTORIAL_MORE_PIECES_DONE">Good work! Click the NEXT button to continue.</String>
<String id="TUTORIAL_CLEAR_ROW">If you complete an entire ROW or COLUMN of Runes, they will disappear! This scores you points and leaves you more room to work with! Complete the row of Runes now.</String>
<String id="TUTORIAL_CLEAR_ROW_DONE">Good job! Remember, you can complete a line either horizontally or vertically. Now, click NEXT to go on.</String>
<String id="TUTORIAL_USE_FORGE">If you can't place a Rune, you can DISCARD it. Do this by clicking the Discard button on the left, or by right-clicking your mouse. Discard a Rune now</String>
<String id="TUTORIAL_COOL_FORGE">You can discard THREE Runes in a row safely, but the fourth will end the game! Luckily, the Forge cools down with every Rune you place successfully. Place a Rune now and watch the Forge cool off.</String>
<String id="TUTORIAL_FORGE_DONE">Very good. Always remember to keep a close eye on the Forge during play. Now, click NEXT to continue.</String>
<String id="TUTORIAL_BIG_MATCH">Things get tricky when there are a lot of Runes on the board. Each new Rune must match shape or color with ALL of the Runes it's next to. Here, try to place this Rune below.</String>
<String id="TUTORIAL_BIG_MATCH_DONE">Nice work! You're almost ready to go! Click NEXT for the last two lessons.</String>
<String id="TUTORIAL_FOURWAY">Grey STONES are wild cards, and can be placed next to any Rune. Place the Stone below.</String>
<String id="TUTORIAL_BOMB">Finally, watch out for SKULLS. These will destroy any Rune they're placed on. This can work for you, or against you. Place the Skull below on an existing Rune.</String>
<String id="TUTORIAL_BOMB_DONE">Excellent! You've completed the tutorial. Press NEXT for some final tips.</String>
<String id="TUTORIAL_DONE">There are 3 levels of difficulty... each has a greater number of colors and shapes for the Runes, making it harder to place them. However, you will score more points on the higher difficulty levels if you succeed! Can you become a Grand Alchemical Emperor?</String>
<String id="TUTORIAL_CLEAR_ROW2">Wrong Place</String>
